Many times we feel like audio and video on a media file are not well synchronised and it appears very annoying. Most of you might be curious to get an idea about how to fix trouble and further you may also want to add few new effects to develop customized videos. To do this, simply open VLC media player on your system and then navigate to Tools option. Now hit the Effects and Filters option from dropdown menu. Further, select video effect or audio effect (whichever you want to adjust). It will allow users to apply wide range of effects and one can also view the changes side by side.
