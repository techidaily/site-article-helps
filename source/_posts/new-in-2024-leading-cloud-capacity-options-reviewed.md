## Part1: Top Best price of unlimited cloud storage for individual users

### 1\. OpenDrive

![opendrive illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/opendrive-1.jpg)

If you need **unlimited cloud storage** with many features, then you could rely on OpenDrive. Indeed, OpenDrive is versatile cloud storage for personal use. It offers **unlimited cloud**, mirror-image backups, and web, desktop, or mobile app access. It also has useful features such as Zoho Docs, which enables the creation of documents and other file kinds within the app. Additionally, you will be amazed by its retention term, which is three times longer than competing services.

Furthermore, the price is one of the best things regarding OpenDrive. At only $9.95 per user each month, the Personal Unlimited plan is pretty cheap. Also, it doesn't have a minimum number of users. Hence, it is good if you don't have anyone to split the bill with.

Meanwhile, Zero-knowledge encryption is one of the most popular security features for online storage, and OpenDrive has it., OpenDrive will create a folder called "secure files." The AES 256-bit encryption protects all the files you put in this folder. You can also create sync and backup tasks in this folder.

### 2\. Icedrive

![icedrive illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/icedrive-1.jpg)

Icedrive just started up in 2019, making it the youngest cloud storage on this list. Nevertheless, it has quickly become one of the best services out there because it started out with zero-knowledge encryption and low prices.

If you use Windows, you can use Explorer to look through your storage space and do things like move, rename, open, and even edit files, just like you would on a local drive. Meanwhile, a custom app for Windows, Mac, and Linux goes even further, letting you browse files, preview documents, and stream your media files with a built-in player without having to download it

The price of Icedrive is probably the best thing about it. If 1TB of storage feels like enough space to you, then $4.17 per month for the annual basis is probably the best deal you can find. Icedrive also has subscriptions for a lifetime for $13.86, which can be a good choice if you plan to use your storage for a long time.

## Part 2: Best price of unlimited cloud storage for business users

### 1\. Google Workspace

![google workspace illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/google-workspace.jpg)

Google Drive, part of Google Workspace, is one of the best-unlimited cloud storage you can use for your business. When you use Google Workspace, you get Google Drive and all the tools that are part of Google workspace, such as Gmail, Meet, Keep, Calendar, Chat and the full suite of office software. You should consider if your company already relies on Google's products or if you need a suite of tools that don't require high-end hardware.

There are many business features in Google Drive and the rest of Workspace. There are a lot of tools for working together and managing things, like desktop apps for Windows and macOS, real-time syncing, encryption, file versioning, and scanning documents. Meanwhile, there is two-factor authentication, group-based policy controls, and encryption are used to keep things safe, with encryption getting better in enterprise plans.

There are four different plans for Google Workspace that you can use for your business. Unfortunately, Google Workspace is not offered **free unlimited cloud storage.** The first plan (Business Starter) costs $4.20 /user/month, which gives you 30 GB of storage per user. Next, another Google Workspace plan (Business Standard) costs $9.60 /per user/month and gives you 2 TB of storage per user. Thirdly, business Plus costs $18 /user/month and gives you 5 TB of storage for each user. Lastly, the Enterprise plan which gives you unlimited storage. However, you must contact them on the official site to know the price.

### 2\. Dropbox

Dropbox's Business Advanced Plan is excellent if you need unlimited cloud storage. The Business Advanced Plan is the Dropbox plan with a price that includes unlimited storage capacity. Unfortunately, Dropbox Advanced Plan is not a **free unlimited cloud storage**. The Advanced Plan for Businesses costs $24 per user each month. With a minimum of three people necessary to join up, the actual monthly cost is $72\. If you prefer to be billed annually, you can save 20%.

The speed of Dropbox is among its most remarkable features. It uploads massive volumes of data at a fraction of the time of its competitors, so you will never lose time waiting for file uploads. In terms of security, Dropbox has gotten a lot better over time. It has 256-bit AES encryption at rest, 128-bit AES encryption in transit, and two-factor authentication, and you can even wipe your device remotely if it gets stolen. You can also choose to host your data in a European data centre.

### 3\. Box

![box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/box.jpg)

Box says that 70% of the 500 companies with the fastest growth use their storage service. One of its most important reasons is that it gives you unlimited cloud storage. As a result, you can interact with team members and provide file access from any device and location. In addition, the platform provides various unrestricted business options with no limit on the number of files that may be uploaded to a cloud server.

Meanwhile, Box can also work with over 1500 other apps, such as Google Workspace, Slack, Salesforce, and Office 365, all popular office productivity and collaboration tools. These apps also make it easy to open, change, and save files.

Regarding security systems, a zero-trust architecture approach ensures that teams can work together safely by using strong user authentication with SSO and MFA support, device security, and information rights management with vector-based watermarking. You also get seven user-friendly permission roles, device trust, and application controls. The Box is FIPS 140-2 certified; even better, every file is encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption at rest and in transit.

Just like a Dropbox Advanced Plan, Box unlimited storage service is not an unlimited free storage. Indeed, the unlimited storage plan price, the cheapest is Business plan which cost $20 per month for each user. You can also get it annually for $15 for each user which lets you save about 25%.

## Part3: Best unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos

### 1\. Flickr Pro

![flickr illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/flickr.jpg)

Flickr does have a free plan, but users can only post up to 1000 photos. Given that most of us take pictures daily, this doesn't seem like a very generous offer. If you want unlimited storage, you'll need to upgrade to Flickr Pro, which costs money. Therefore, you can subscribe monthly for $8.49 or annually for $80.04\. If you join the annual plan, you gain access to amazing bonuses, such as two free months of Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.

Flickr Pro includes limitless storage space and is compatible with iOS, Android, and PC web browsers. In addition, Flickr permits the upload of JPEG, PNG, and non-animated GIF files but not RAW images, which may be disappointing to professional photographers.

If this limitation does not bother you, Flickr's additional features compensate for it. One of its coolest features is the AutoUploader uploading tool, which allows you to upload a collection of photos from multiple sources. Moreover, Flickr, like many commercial websites, uses SSL/TLS, the small green lock next to a browser's URL address bar, to create a secure tunnel protected by 128-bit or higher AES encryption, making sure that communication between your devices and Flickr is safe.

## Frequently Asked Question
