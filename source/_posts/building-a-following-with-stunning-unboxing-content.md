It is essential for you to create attractive reels because these reels can drive 67% more engagement to your page. The tips mentioned below can help you proficiently in your **unboxing Instagram** success:

### Tip 1: Good Camera Equipment and Recording Environment

You should have a good camera for shooting videos because it is a basic part of reels. If you shoot an **unboxing video on Instagram** without a good camera, it will bore the users.

### Tip 2: Keep the Focus on the Product Throughout the Video

Make sure to set the focus of your camera before recording reels. **Unboxing the Instagram** page should always focus on showing the product in higher quality. Imagine you shoot a video of a makeup box from Sephora, and if the focus is not on the box but on the table, do you think viewers will like it? They will ultimately bounce back, impacting your page's followers and reels.

Thus, always give first priority to the product. It will be a positive thing for your unboxing influencer career. Keep your camera neat and clean, and check its focus from time to time while shooting the video.

### Tip 3: Keep the Video Short

### Tip 5: Add Captions for Your Unboxing Reels
