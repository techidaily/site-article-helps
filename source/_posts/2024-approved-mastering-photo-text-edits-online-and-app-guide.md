## Part 3: Basic Tips to Edit Text on Photo with Ease

There are multiple tips that can be employed for a clear display of text across a photo. Being a photo text editor, you need to be careful about every element that is across the photo. Thus, to make your photos look perfect with the added text, you should be aware of the few tips that are featured below:

### 1\. Understanding the Perspective

![understand image perspective](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-9.jpg)

### 2\. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties

It is essential for you to figure out the right contrast of text that matches or immerses perfectly with the photo. This helps you ensure that the text of your photo stands out to the viewers with no affective disturbances. Not only will it look good, but it also won't tamper with the quality of the photo that it holds across.

### 3\. Look for Negative Space

When you consider adding text across a photo, it is highly advised that you should always go for an option that contains a general space for covering.

### 4\. Framing the Text

If you go for prominence, you should always use elements that are meant for bringing prominence. Text that is to be highlighted with purity across a photo should be framed rather than any other tactful technique. This helps you create a clear focal point while sustaining the quality of the image. Following this, it also keeps a good view across the photo as a subjective associate picture.
