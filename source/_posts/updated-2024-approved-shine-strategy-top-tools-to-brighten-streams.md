2. Now you will find two options. Either use any of the existing templates to create a video from scratch or upload your video from your storage. Upload your desired video here.
3. Now find the option to adjust the brightness of your video. All the tools mentioned above will have the option to adjust brightness. All you need to do is find that option, and you are good to go.
