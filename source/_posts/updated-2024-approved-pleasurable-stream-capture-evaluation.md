## Part 3\. How to Edit the Video After Export from Funimate

Editing videos is a difficult undertaking, particularly if you don't have the right tools. Filmora is about as versatile as it gets when it comes to video editing software. Filmora is Wondershare's entry-level, simple-to-use, high-quality video editing software. 4k and gif support are now standard capabilities for most video editing tools, but titles are something Filmora excels at. There are many excellent video editing programs available, but few of them provide the combination of ease of use and capability that Wondershare Filmora does. To begin video editing, you must first import movies from your PC.

Overall, we feel Filmora is one of the most mind-blowing premium options accessible, especially when combined with other video-related tools from the company. The solution enables you to share instances or gatherings with your colleagues, as well as independently record the sound and video of your framework. The Filmora video editor now supports true 4k videos (both 3840\*2160 and 4096\*2160), as well as the creation of proxy files for a more fluid video editing experience. In Filmora, you may edit with proxy video files and subsequently export with the full-sized resolution.

**Step 1: Get Filmora Toolkit, Install It, And Run It**

To begin your editing experience with Filmora, first, visit the official website and download the most recent version of Wondershare Filmora. When the download is finished, launch the program and click the New Project button to view the product's underlying window interface.

**Step 2: Remove Any Unnecessary Background Sounds**

Aside from the video editor, DemoCreator Audio Editor allows you to improve the sound of your video. If there is any noise in the background of your voice-over, you can quickly remove it from the whole clip or a section of the film where you believe the sound is unprofessional. Also, you can add your favorite ones to the Funimate videos in Filmora, simply import the files and add them to the timeline. Within the timeline of this video editor, you can also separate the audio from your video clips and cut or sync it with the video.
