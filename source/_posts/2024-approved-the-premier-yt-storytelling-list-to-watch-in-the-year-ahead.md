_**Subscriber Count: <17 million**_

TED or TED conference is a YouTube channel that promotes international content, whether on science, technology, culture, or academics. They invite the world's greatest minds to give their insight on a particular topic and tell a story to connect with a broader audience.

Videos on TED are usually posted daily; in this past month alone, they've shared more than 50 videos on their channel. What makes TED different is its story-driven narration. This is evident in their most viewed content, such as [Inside the mind of a master procrastinator - by Tim Urban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU).

### 2) Internet Historian
