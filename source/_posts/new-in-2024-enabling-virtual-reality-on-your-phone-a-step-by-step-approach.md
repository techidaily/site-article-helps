After that, you have to download now some VR software to completely enjoy your new device. You can also download demos and apps which help you to understand what applications and software you have to download for the smooth running of the device. As it is a very early age of VR concept, so there are no huge choices of apps and experiences available yet. But there are so many 360-view videos that are present on the internet for experiencing this concept. It depends on what VR kit you are using because Oculus store provides you a very vast variety of apps that are advanced.

Now, the controls which are needed for the procedure depends on the VR kit you are using. Many of them just have a single NFC-enabled button. But theoretically, VR games and apps can also be linked with Bluetooth.

But there are also present so many options in the market which could be of your choices like the Homido or the Freefly VR. But apps and content can be hit and miss.

One of the most important steps is to select the right [VR kit](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your experience. There are so many present in the market for this reason. Let’s take a look at some of the best ones.

#### Google Cardboard

You just need to set your phone into the kit and after following some instructions you are good to go. You will be able to enjoy an immersed set of 360-videos content available for it. A fascinating thing is no matter which smartphone you are using [Google Cardboard](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) gets away with it. It is a very good material and you can also buy it from amazon and other sites.

#### Samsung Gear VR

If you are using a fairly recent Samsung smartphone, it is highly recommended to choose the [Samsung Gear VR](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is very much sophisticated and better in quality as compared to Google Cardboard. It is very comfortable kit according to most of the reviews which fit well with your head. It is also not very expensive, selling now approximately at a rate of $100\. So, if you have a good phone then you can also afford this VR.

#### LG 360 VR

One of the most serious rivals of the Samsung Gear VR is [LG 360 VR](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

It bears very bad reviews and not recommended at all. Even if you are an owner of LG G5, it is good to buy Google Cardboard instead of LG 360 VR.

## How to choose a good VR Phone?

Obviously, you want to use the smartphone you are already having your VR experience. But it is also necessary to use the phone with better specs and quality to enjoy the virtual reality at best. If you are going to buy a smartphone for your VR experience, try to buy the latest one.

For example, if you are using Samsung Gear VR you must buy a latest Samsung smartphone to enjoy most of the features. Same in the case with HTC Vive. But if you have Google Cardboard then you don’t have to worry about the brand, just pick any of the latest smartphones, it will be good to go with your VR box. So, these are some instructions which can help you in enjoying the virtual reality.
