## Part 1 Add audio to PowerPoint

Adding audio and recording audio are two different aspects yet taken synonymously. This section will explain how to add audio to PowerPoint with an easy step-by-step guide.

To your PowerPoint presentation, you can add audio, such as music, narration, or sound bites.

**Steps to add audio to PowerPoint from PC**

## Part 2 Record audio on PowerPoint

We all know that PowerPoint is an excellent tool for creating amazing PPTs, provided you know everything creative about the device.

One of its creativity we're going to unleash in the form of learning how to record audio on PowerPoint is as follows.

Your PC must have a microphone, sound card, and speakers to record and hear any audio.

##### Step1 Design your PowerPoint

TIP: Use images and limit text to engage viewers/listeners better.

##### Step2 Hit the Slide Show tab

NOTE: Do not include Audio under Insert and Record Audio since it doesn't synchronize timings to automatically move the slides with the Audio.

![click slideshow tab ppt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/click-slideshow-tab-ppt.jpg)

##### Step3 Hit the Record Slide Show

NOTE: Audio may begin getting recorded on its own if you are working on the older version of PowerPoint. It may still work, but this version offers reduced functionality.

##### Step4 Choose Record from Beginning or REcord from Current Slide based upon your requirements

NOTE: You can re-record the PowerPoint slides by hitting the Record Slide Show and Selecting Record from the Current Slide.

![record from current slide ppt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/record-from-current-slide-ppt.jpg)

##### Step5 Hit the Record tab to begin recording narration

NOTE: PowerPoint will offer a three-second countdown before it begins recording.

##### Step6 Record narration and avoid reading text on the slide-out loud to viewers. Hit the blue Replay tab to listen to the recorded Audio and make sure that it got properly recorded

Hit the Advance tab that reads Advance to the following animation or slides to record the narration for the next slide. However, you need to make sure to stop talking while doing this.

##### Step7 Hit the 'X' or the Escape button present in the top right panel after recording the Audio. You will notice a speaker icon on slides with Audio over it

Save the video by hitting the File tab.

Select Export to confirm.

## Part 3 Adjust audio on PowerPoint

This section will look at editing the added Audio into PowerPoint. As we've already gathered steps on adding Audio to PowerPoint and recording Audio on PowerPoint, it's time to move a step ahead into the editing panel as follows.

### I. Trim audio in PowerPoint presentation

Let's suppose we've added long audio to our presentation, and we just only need it a few seconds long. So, we need to trim its audio by hitting the specific tabs.

##### Step1 Click the audio icon you’ve just added to the presentation in previous steps

##### Step2 Click Playback> Trim Audio as shown below

![trim ppt audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/trim-ppt-audio.jpg)

##### Step3 Within the pop-up window, you need to use the red and green markers to adjust the start and endpoint of the audio

![adjust audio ppt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adjust-audio-ppt.jpg)
