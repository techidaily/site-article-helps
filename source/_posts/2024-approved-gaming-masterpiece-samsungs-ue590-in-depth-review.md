 You may find numbers of 4K monitors in market but they have very general specifications that are not suitable to gamers. These simple 4K monitors can serve office needs but cannot be the companion for gaming world. The fact is that it is essential to have a high speed, crystal clear and delay free monitor for gaming so that gamers can have trouble free processing for their action games. If you are searching for best gaming monitors in the market then probably you may find it complicated to choose the best one with all suitable features. That is why we have brought to you the details review of one of the highly rated gaming monitor: Samsung UE590\. Check the details below before investing on a new gaming monitor.

**_Pros:_**

* Designed with AMD FreeSync compatibility.
* Offers exceptional and incredible gaming performance.
* Impressive color performance.
* Incredible response time that suits for most of the action games.
* Attractive physical design.

### Accessories in the Box

 When we talk about 4K gaming monitors then Design and Style are always some of the interesting features. Samsung has added lots of creativity in design of UE590\. You will find 1 inch thick bezel with eye catching quintessential silver on black scheme for color. Its body has round edges with black brushed plastic material. One of the most unique features is its stand that allows easy adjustments for positioning of this 4K color monitor. It can offer great viewing response with 170 degree by 160 degree ability. The sad part is that gamers can adjust its view only up to their chest level and hence they need to sit in a stressful posture by keeping their neck downwards while enjoying games for hours.

#### 2.Ports and Connectivity

 This monitor comes with Display Port and HDMI 2.0 port. The great thing to know about HDMI 2.0 is its ability to serve impressive results at 60Hz frequency range while working over 60 frame refresh rate. Further, it can also provide better tuning to third party media devices and graphics. The FreeSync technology in this monitor makes use of DisplayPort 1.2 connectivity that ensures great rendering response for games with higher synchronization. The performance goes much better with HDMI2.0 port as it managed 1ms response time that is big advantage against most of 4ms to 9ms rated monitors. But the sad part is missing USB port in this monitor.
