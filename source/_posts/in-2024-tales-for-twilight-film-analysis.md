## Part II. How to Choose Bedtime Stories for Kids

Like with music, some bedtime videos are better for relaxation, while others are better for fun. Good bedtime story videos will relax your child, aid in their wind-down, and help them get ready for bed. They calm racing thoughts and aid in acclimatizing young bodies and brains to a peaceful night.

### Essential Elements of An Effective Bedtime Story Video

Here are the elements of an effective bedtime story video.

**1\. Plot**

One of the story's most essential aspects is the plot. It propels the story's action and aids in presenting the events' logical progression as you guide your central character toward the intended happy ending or catastrophic finish. A simple plot's structure is its core. Even a short story can have a beginning, middle, and end that are all delineated. A more complex plot, however, will contain a few extra pieces.

* **Exposition**

The exposition sets the scene for the conflict or narrative driver at the story's start by introducing the cast of characters.

* **Rising Action**

A struggle that sets the setting for the plot to unfold will be created early on by a sequence of events and an igniting occurrence.

* **Climax**

The part of the narrative where the tension is raised frequently caps off at the turning point.

* **Falling action**

The subplots are resolved here as the drama advances from its thrilling finale to its resolution and conclusion.

* **Denouement**

The part of the story where everything is resolved and all loose ends are tied.

**2\. Music**

The soporific effects of watching bedtime stories set to music in three-act patterns are enhanced. In their dreams, people often have three acts. These structures frequently need more apparent segmentation and boundary lines. The idea of a beginning, middle, and the ending is helped by adding music. Music alters how bedtime story videos are communicated to the audience's brains. It intensifies the feeling and can be utilized to highlight the three-act framework even though it is not overtly included in the plot. Imagine having a dream that is structured like a three-act play. It is the ideal sleeping pattern.

### A Quick Video & Audio Edit Guide

To edit your video's audio track, follow the simple steps below.

##### Step1Add the video and audio files you want to change

To access the main editing window, open the Filmora Video Editor and choose **New Project**. To add the audio or video files, click **Import**.

##### Step2Start making changes to the audio track

Second, drag the video or audio file into the tool's Timeline. After that, you can begin modifying your video's audio track.

* **Separate audio from video**

To highlight a video, place the cursor inside of it. Click again, and this time select **Audio Detach.**

* **Make audio adjustments**

A panel for altering the video clip will appear when you double-click it on the Timeline. If you select the **Audio** column, you may easily alter the speed, volume, and pitch or add a fade-in/fade-out effect to the audio file.

* **Add audio from the designed audio library, such as music or sound effects.**

Select a music clip and audio effects from the audio library by clicking the **Audio** tab. Drag and drop the audio from the music library to the spot on the audio track where you want it to appear. After that, tap the play button to see if the modifications were successful.

* **Record and add a voiceover**

To start recording, select **Media > Record > Record Voiceover**. When you're done, press the **"Stop"** button.

##### Step3Save the changes

After modifying the audio track, click **Export** to save your changes. Here, you may instantly publish the new movie to YouTube or Vimeo or download it in several formats. Of course, you may also download the movie in mp3 format. Additionally, the DVD tab allows you to burn a DVD creation.
