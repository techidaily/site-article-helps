## 1. Chair in a Room

Chair in a Room is a horror game for the Google Cardboard. You play a lawyer who is on his way to the top of the corporate ladder. However, you are visited by your business partner and the ghosts of the past, present and future. The goal of the game is to find the child-like innocence inside of you to unlock the happy ending.

If you want a good scare, then this is the VR game that you should play. You will feel your heart pounding as you progress through the game. It really feels like it was made for VR and not just a port. On the downside, you need a fast smartphone and good headphones to enjoy the game. It was designed for the Nexus 5 and above, and devices with lower specs might have trouble running the game.

## 2. BombSquad VR for Cardboard

BombSquad VR for Cardboard is an arcade game where players must avoid getting hit by bombs, and at the same time capture flags. Up to eight players can play at the same time. To play the game, you need a gamepad or another Android device to act as a controller. While it costs $2.99, you also get the BombSquad Pro that allows you to play the non-VR version of the game. The game features networked multiplayer mode, advanced ragdoll face-plant physics, lots of explosions, pirates, barbarians, ninja, and chefs.

It is a fun game that you can play with your friends. If you enjoy the normal BombSquad game, then you will definitely love the VR version. However, just like the other VR games, it requires a lot of power. There are some players that find the game too jumpy and glitch. They can’t hold a position.

BAMF VR is a simple game that only requires you to push a single button. The objective of the game is to explore the world and collect crystals.

To teleport, you need to hit the button. It is recommended to play it while standing up or sitting on a swivel chair because it requests the player to turn around.

BAMF VR is one of the best VR games for the Google Cardboard. While it is simple, it has imaginative puzzles. There are no downsides to the game; except players want more levels because it is easy to beat the game.

## 4. Sisters

VR is the best medium for horror games. You just need to seat back and look around as supernatural stuff happen around you. It is best to play with headphones to fully enjoy the experience.

It has simple look based controls that will allow players to pick up and play the game. It has a scary digitally painted environment that will truly immerse you into the game. And combined with the spooky soundtrack, it feels like you are really there.

If you want to be scared, then go play Sisters. It is best to prank your friends who think that VR games are not that scary. However, there are reports that it keeps on crashing on low-end Android phones.
