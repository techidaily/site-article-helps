Most online users watch videos on Vimeo directly through the web browser. This is specifically applicable to computer users. If you want Vimeo loop video for any desired video, the steps are simple.

Step 3: After making the changes, press Enter key. The same video will play in a loop until you pause the video or close the web browser's tab.
