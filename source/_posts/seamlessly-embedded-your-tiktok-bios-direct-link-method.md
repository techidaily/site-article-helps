Are you unable to add a link to the TikTok bio? In this section, you can find the possible reasons why you can't see the option of adding a link to your bio:

* **Unavailability in Some Regions:** If you have met the above requirements and are still unable to add a website link to your TikTok bio, it means this feature is not available in your region because of location limitations.
