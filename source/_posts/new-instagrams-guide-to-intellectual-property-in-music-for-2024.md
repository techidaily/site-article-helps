## Instagram's Guide to Intellectual Property in Music

Instagram is a popular social platform with over 2 billion monthly active users and is a great place to share your music and connect with new fans. However, before you start sharing your tunes, you must ensure you understand its music copyright rules.

In this article, we’ll give you a comprehensive guide to understanding **Instagram’s rules about copyright music.** We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.

## How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?

Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the system is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.

Instagram's recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.

Here’s what happens to your Instagram account if the system detects copyrighted content:

* Your post may be muted on Instagram.
* Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you're broadcasting a track during a Livestream.
* Instagram may take down your post entirely.

## Instagram Music Copyright Rules

Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:

* **Apply A Video When Sharing Music:** Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.
* **Keep The Video Short:** Make sure your video is short because if you post a more extended clip with copyrighted music, Instagram’s detection system will limit your content.
* **Unlimited Music For Your Instagram Stories:** If you share a story on Instagram, the platform allows you to add unlimited copyrighted music to it from its built-in music library.

### (1) How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram

There are several workarounds for using **copyrighted music on Instagram:**

* **Collaborating With Artists Or Musicians:** Reach out to local musicians or new artists to see if you can collaborate and create custom sounds for your Instagram videos. Not only will you have copyright-free music that you can use, but you will also support independent artists!
* **Asking For Permission:** To avoid copyright issues on Instagram, you can contact the creator to seek permission before using their content.
* **Pay For The Copyrighted Music:** You can opt to pay for royalty-free music on your IG posts, live streams, or IGTV from various online libraries, such as [Pixaby,](https://pixabay.com/) [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), and [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/).
* **Give Credit In Your Caption:** To use copyrighted music on your IG content, make sure to give credit to the original creator in your post’s caption.
* **Post Instagram Reel Videos:** Reels are short videos of about 15 seconds with a built-in music feature that applies a sticker to your content with the song's details and can save you from Instagram copyright music issues.
