### 3\. Engaging background music

It's one of the essential points to make your podcast trailer more amazing. It would help if you had to add some significant sound effects and music to your podcast trailer. This can help in making it more attractive to the audience.

### 4\. Attractive voice

It would be more awesome if you made a podcast trailer with a narrator's voice. You can narrate the central theme or idea of the podcast.

### 5\. Make it interesting for each episode

Each podcast has a unique theme, so it's best to have each one its trailer. But the thing to remember here is that don't use the same intro or lines every time. You have to be unique in every podcast trailer episode. Otherwise, the audience will lose interest in your trailers.
