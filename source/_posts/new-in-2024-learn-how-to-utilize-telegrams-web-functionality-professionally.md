## Part 1\. What Is Telegram?

Firstly, let's learn more about this useful tool we use every day for communication.

**Compatibility:** As mentioned in the beginning, one of the best advantages of Telegram is that this communication service is compatible with computers, including Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. But this does not mean that the Android and iOS users are not out of luck, as Telegram has a dedicated app for both of these platforms.

However, if you don't want to install Telegram Desktop on your PC, you can use the Telegram web version instead. You can do this in two ways:

* By visiting the Telegram official website and start communicating directly from the browser.
* By installing the [Telegram extension on the Chrome browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telegram-for-chrome/djjkifoefibfoodilnhkmbhmadbgacni).

As to the Chrome extension, it is easy for you to install it in the browser by clicking the official link given above. In this article, we will focus on how to use Telegram in browser-based PC version conveniently.
