## MPOW Microphone Trouble? Here's How to Make It Work on Your PC

When you’re using a microphone such as MPOW attached to your computer, you may be frustrated as the microphone is not picking up your voice and you cannot be heard on calls. But since you’ve come across this article, you don’t have to be scratching your head asking why your headset microphone isn’t working. We’ve put together some methods to help you troubleshoot the issues.

 Before getting started, you should do a restart. A simple reboot can resolve many issues almost immediately. But before restarting your computer, be sure to bookmark this page in case the restart didn’t help you fix your issues and you’ll need to follow the instructions below for further troubleshooting.

 If restarting your computer didn’t do the trick, try to connect or pair your headset to another computer. If it isn’t working on the different computer, chances are your microphone or headset is malfunctioning or damaged. In this case, you need to reach out to the manufacturer for further assistance. You can send it for repairs or replacement if it’s still under warranty.

 If you’re quite sure that your headset isn’t broken, try these fixes:

1. [Run the audio troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Set your microphone as the default device](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Make sure apps have access to your microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Make sure your microphone is enabled](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [Download and install Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## 1\. Run the audio troubleshooter

 When you run into audio or sound issues, using the troubleshooting tool can help you identify what’s going on. To run the audio troubleshooter, take these steps:

 1) In the search box on the taskbar, type **audio troubleshooter** . Then click **Find and fix problems with playing sound**  from the results.  
  
![run the audio troubleshooter Windows](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audion-troubleshooter.png)

## 2\. Update your audio driver

 Most of the audio or sound issues are driver related. If you’re using an audio driver which is outdated or corrupted, your headset mic would not be working properly and the sound coming from your headset could be crackling, popping or static. In this situation, updating your audio driver becomes quite crucial as this may fix your issues immediately.

 You can update your audio driver from the manufacturer’s website of your sound card and you may also need to update your MPOW driver corresponding with your product model from the[download](https://www.xmpow.com/pages/download) page. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and you need to know the specifications of your PC.

 However, if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

## 3\. Set your microphone as the default device

 Normally, when your microphone is connected, Windows can automatically detect it and set it as the default input device. But you may have multiple input or recording devices connected. It would occur to you that your computer is using another device instead of the one you’re attempting to. In order to set your MPOW microphone as your input device, follow the instructions below:

 1) At the bottom-right corner of your taskbar, right-click your speaker icon and select **Open Sound settings** .

![Open Sound Control Panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sound-control-panel.png)

 3) When the Sound window opens, select the**Recording** tab. Click on your microphone and then click**Set Default > OK** .
