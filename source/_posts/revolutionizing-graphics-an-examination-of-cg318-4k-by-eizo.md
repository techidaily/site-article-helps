You must be interested to know about the flexibility options associated with this larger monitor. The best part to discuss here is the adjustment and movement options. Users can easily make adjustments for height this screen to keep it at level of eyes because it offers easy movements in up down motion. It is also possible to rotate this monitor via base and column so that it can be easily aligned with other display screens in the office or studio. You will find its thin panel size very useful as it allows easy placement over smaller desk and you can find enough space to place other essentials like mouse, keyboard and the color grading panel.

#### 2.Self Calibration

This automatic setting helps to provide efficient results as compared to other competitive models and it will also save much time of users. The calibration sensor for this 4K monitor is hidden below top bezel of screen and it simply swings down on screen when calibration task is running. When this sensor is not in use then it automatically swings back to its normal position. As this monitor is designed with very slick design so it would be quite difficult to use any calibration instrument over it. Thus automated adjustments suit it better.

 Users can set schedules calibration timings for this monitor and when that schedule needs to run then your standby monitor will wake up automatically and it will spend few minutes for automatic calibration. Once this task is completed then it normally goes back to sleep mode. This is really an intelligent feature for a 4k monitor and assists professionals in easy management of screen settings for their various projects. The build in sensor ensures perfect optimization for calibrated screen. You will find its Color Edge Navigator Software tool easy to setup and it can assist users for their video and photography needs. It managed automatic switching of desired color specific features as per need of current project running on screen.

 Professionals who need to work on Cinema settings or Broadcast applications will find preset modes of EIZO ColorEdge CG318 very interesting. The range of modes includes DCI, SMPTE-C, REC. 709 and EBU. These settings assist users to enjoy gamma value adjustments and color specs with ease. If you need more efficient color settings for some high end projects then the built in type calibration sensor and advanced software tool can help you to manage brightness settings for each preset. Thus it is possible to optimize everything as per specific workflow.
