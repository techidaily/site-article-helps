<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Hubsan X4 is one of the smaller drones out there, and it features a 6-system gyro as well as a 4 channel 2.4 GHZ control. The battery is very good since it delivers 7 minutes despite the very small size of this particular product. The drone on its own is very durable, and the fact that you can even take pictures with it is rather nice. It doesn't allow you to record videos, and that's a bit of a bummer. But if you get past that, you will find the Hubsan X4 to be one of the best drones for kids, one that delivers a pretty good value for your money for sure.

#### 3\. UDI U854 FPV

What makes this drone so distinct? IF you want a good drone for beginners with a wacky design, this would be it. The flight time is around 9 minutes, and you do have 480p video recording and photo taking at 1 MP. It's an excellent camera, although at the price of $179 you will need to pay a premium for it. The design is indeed amazing and the fact that you do get video and photo features is a very good thing for sure. Try to keep that in mind as it will certainly help you a lot. They do have a headless mode where you can ignore the direction, and the drone also does 360 degree flips which is really interesting.

#### 4\. Eachine H8

![eachine h8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eachine-h8.jpg)

At around $30, this is maybe the cheapest drone out there. It doesn't cost a lot, but at the same time, it's also light, at around 20 g. It shines because of it, and it does manage to bring in front a delightful, unique experience that you do not want to miss. The LED lights included here and the fact that you have 7 minutes of flight makes it a very interesting option, and you do get an option for it to return home which is rather interesting as well. Overall, you get a very good value for your money with this one.

#### 5\. Syma X8C
