## Part 3: How Do I Make a Good Picture Collage?

Here’re a few useful tips to make the perfect photo collage:

#### Size

Choosing the size of pictures is one of the most key considerations. When creating a collage, you can work with a mix of sizes. If you wish to highlight any particular photo, use a large size for it. Keep in mind that the layout affects the images you select.

#### Colors

When creating a collage, ensure that the snapshots you choose complement each other. The color scheme must blend in perfectly and should appeal to the eyes. Never put together colors that clash with each other. Pick photos in contrasting colors or you might also arrange the colors in a pattern around the collage.

#### Themes

It is always advisable to create a photo collage based on a theme. Choose photos that best describe your chosen image. For instance; if you are creating a collage for your brother’s birthday, you can choose snapshots highlighting the special events in his life.

#### Layout

This is another vital factor. The size of the photos you pick affects your layout and vice-versa. Your collage’s layout affects the color flow and the entire appeal. The photos you want to be prominent must be placed in the center and should stand out.

#### Cohesion

Ultimately, the major difference between an artful collage and a collection of photos is visual cohesion. Although this might sound like a lofty artistic undertaking, it’s quite simple. Select photos with similar color schemes for creating a collage with a unified feel.

#### Borders and Frames

Borders & frames help you add an extra edge to the photo collage. If you have used a common color in your photos that complement the photos, use it as your collage’s border. Furthermore, you can use symbols to add that additional edge.
