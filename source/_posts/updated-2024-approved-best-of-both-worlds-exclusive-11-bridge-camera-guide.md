You can focus on two major differences when it comes to DSLRs and bridge cameras. In a few mirrorless cameras or DSLR models, the one-inch sensor is used, and the rest are bigger than that while the [bridge cameras have smaller sensors](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/2910661). If you are looking for similar picture quality as DSLRs at affordable prices, you may choose for bridge cameras.

Secondly, you can find built-in lenses that are non-removable in bridge cameras, whereas DSLR gives you the option to change lenses. The bridge cams offer wide-ranging subjects and features, but you cannot swap to the fast prime lens or a [super wide-angle lens](https://www.digitalphotomentor.com/5-mistakes-beginners-make-using-a-wide-angle-lens-and-how-to-avoid-them/) for low-light photography or change to a macro lens for close-up pictures.

It includes the 24x zoom lens with a constant f/2.8 aperture and the 12.1-megapixel sensor. The Panasonic FZ300 has many more advanced features apart from the older features from its older version. It is an appealing choice for photographers looking for a long-zoom best bridge camera.

**Pros**\-

* Constant f/2.8 max aperture
* Fast, wide-angle 24x zoom provides good overall optical performance for its type
* Generally good image quality for such a small sensor
* Very close macro mode
* Very low prefocused shutter lag
* RAW and RAW+JPEG file support

**Cons**\-

* Limited dynamic range and poor high ISO performance compared to cameras with larger sensors
* Soft corners at some focal lengths even stopped-down
* Strong distortion correction at wide-angle (typical)
* Default noise reduction is a little heavy-handed (though NR can be adjusted)
* Area-specific noise reduction can lead to rough edges and other artifacts
* JPEG colors could be better
* Clunky menu system
