# The perfect resolution for immersive VR

 For those people who understands everything about screens from TV to phone, they know what resolution really means. However, when we talk about Virtual Reality Resolutions, it can be somewhat a little confusing. There are some VR headsets that can be used in one screen that outputs 2 images while the others have 2 screens.

### Perfect Resolution for VR: 8K per Eye

 Compare to bigger televisions sets we have today, along with a screen that is only inches from the face of the viewer, any extra pixels create a huge different to the whole quality of the image and offers immersive effect. However, what most people do not realize that more pixel will cause the fewer problem in the long run.

### More pixels, fewer problems

 According to Luckey, taking care and doing improvement on the current resolution of the Rift is the main area of focus. He added that each time they throw more amount of pixels on it, the more it will create a difference. On the other hand, according to the Oculus VP of Product Nate Mitchell, the last and final consumer version of the product will be as good as the HD prototype after it sees the release.

### Latency and Position

 Latency is another major problem for delivering optimum and realistic VR. The time between the things moving your head and seeing the appropriate view for the angle is the key if you want to make a realistic space. However, this is far from reality. Mitchell and Luckey claimed that they can get their hardware below the threshold for the perception of human, devoid of any astronomical cost. Plus, the hardware will team all the latency out of their end of their pipeline.

 The main reason here is that the hardware is just part of the latency equation, and even when the image lag that was introduced by the Rift is the 1 or 2 milliseconds that was imposed by the USB transfer cable, the engine of the game has to keep up along with that degree of performance.

 Aside from that, maintaining the latency low is a key whenever executing plans for the positional tracking – maintaining the track of the position of the user the head moves forward and backward or side to side than just roaming in place. This is said to be the most crucial part, which needs to be added to the virtual reality experience.

 So, typically, higher resolutions are at all times better. The only thing here is that you need to worry about the limitations, which the panels brings but as well as the added price. According to Michael Abrash from Oculus, he claimed that 16k per eye-filling that is filled with 180 of view is forthcoming retinal resolution, however then again the eyes of a human are a just high resolution in the center and quite blurred elsewhere. But the resolution alone is not good enough to Virtual Reality as the brains take in data coming from masses of other sensory and visual cues in order to accept experiences as 100% real.
