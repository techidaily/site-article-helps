## Part 3\. Related FAQs

### Does Zoom work with Skype?

You may now zoom inside of Skype. Although it may be hard to read, we're not referring to a competing application. One benefit is the simplicity with which people may be invited to the Zoom conference immediately from Skype. Conveniently, you may utilize the two aforementioned clips concurrently with this plugin and swap between them as needed. After being installed, the plugin adds additional items to Skype for Business' right-click menu. As a result, starting a new Zoom meeting won't be too difficult. Please be aware that Slype for Business must be restarted in order for the changes to be visible.

### Is Skype Zoom free?

Skype was created to make it possible for individuals to interact with one another for free, no matter where they are. By installing the app on your smartphone and making an account, you can access the app. Unless you wish to contact them on their landline or cellphone, in which case you may purchase a premium membership, Skype is free. You may now join a call on Skype as a guest, eliminating the need to register for an account. Zoom, on the other hand, is a more recent invention. The 2013 debut of the cloud-based video conferencing application has witnessed a significant surge in use. According to Skype, because the meeting links have no expiry date, you may make them in advance and invite participants at any moment. Whether you started the call or are only a participant, you may start it as long as you have the link. Once you have a link, you may use it whenever you wish to join the conversation. Links can be used again in the future.

### How do I open Skype Zoom?

One-on-one conversations can be made using Zoom as well, but you may prefer Skype since it's simpler to use and has less security concerns. If security is your first concern, you may want to stay with Skype unless you're planning to set up a call for a large group. However, you might use Zoom if the advantages it has to offer simply make things simpler. You must go to the Meet Now page on Skype in order to begin a call using your browser. Share the provided URL after selecting the "Create a Free Meeting" option.

As a result, we've provided easy methods for setting up Zoom and Skype meetings on Mac and PC.
