### Some Basic Formats

1. **English should be written in Capital.**
2. **Mark Interior/Exterior view**

EXT. (exterior)

INT. (interior)

EXT./INT. or INT./EXT. :

It means that the scene will continuously move from outside to inside or vice versa.

1. **Scene Location**

This section explains two primary subjects: how the scenario is presented and what happens there (the character's actions). When writing this part, keep the following things in mind. Well first, dialogue cannot directly follow a slug line; instead, there are usually scenes and descriptions of action. Second, because the screenplay is not a novel, psychological or other non-visual descriptions must be avoided to convey what the "audience" can see. Rather than, you should simply describe the emotional shifts in the character, giving the actor some leeway to perform naturally.

1. **Time**

The determination of time is also a basic format. For example, DAY, NIGHT, etc. Generally, all of them are followed by a "-".

1. **An Example of Slug Line**

INT. SITTING ROOM OF MY HOME - DAY

### Actual movie script as an examples

**INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000**

SOMEONE'S POV - MAYBE OURS

I was moving along a hallway of an ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY, past doors - some open, some closed - as if looking for somebody - and maybe not for benign reasons.

FRANK (V.O.)

When I was young, I thought house painters painted houses.

We glimpse some of the older men and women in the rooms, but like everyone else in their lives, disregard them and keep looking for someone else.

### **Dialogue**

Dialogue cannot exist without a character, as dialogue is the expression of a character's point of view, and the character is relating the relationship between dialogue and the character. It is a vital tool to develop the character beautifully and provides rhythm to the plot with a tone.

### **Parenthetical**

We use Parenthetical in a screenplay by placing the brackets. It can be used directly under the name of the specific character before speaking the indicating sentences and to make an alert voice for the scene.

### **Dialogue**

Dialogue cannot exist without a character, as dialogue is the expression of a character's point of view, and the character is relating the relationship between dialogue and the character. It is a vital tool to develop the character beautifully and provides rhythm to the plot with a tone.

### **Parenthetical**

We use Parenthetical in a screenplay by placing the brackets. It can be used directly under the name of the specific character before speaking the indicating sentences and to make an alert voice for the scene.

## Part 3\. Make your script come true using Filmora

The regular video editing processes won't be covered in length here. Next, I will show you what changes Filmora can bring to your movie videos.

### **[Color Correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

It's common to describe a video as having a cinematic sense and aesthetic, which is mostly based on the overall color tone of the video. However, expert-level custom color matching demands not only your expertise but also your own color sensitivity, therefore it is not recommended for all beginners. With the help of a range of in-app preset LUTs, you can simply alter the color of your films and give them a more cinematic feel using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
