##### Step2 Make An Intro

In the next step, start by creating an intro. To do so, open the **"Media"** tab, select a template, and drop it in the timeline once it is downloaded.

Now, head to the **"Titles"** tab, choose a text style you like and drop it in the timeline. Adjust both tracks on the template and your video file.

Click the **text track** in the timeline, add the intro text, preferably the quiz topic, and change the text color and style as you want. You can also use the **Advanced** option to add animation to your text. Click **"OK"** to save the changes.

##### Step3 Add A Quiz To The Timeline

In the third step, use the **"Titles"** tab to add the GK question and answers to your video. Also, adjust the display time and text on the timeline properly.
