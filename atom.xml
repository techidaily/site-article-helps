Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

Now, by integrating Artificial Intelligent features, we can use any online photo background changer to instantly remove the existing background of our images (or replace it with a new one). From all the available options, I have listed some of the most perfect photo background changer tools that you can readily use.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-Changing-the-Background-in-your-Photos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-Changing-the-Background-in-your-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?</h2><p>Ideally, you can consider using an image background changer due to either of the following reasons:</p><ul><li>While clicking an image, there could be unwanted objects or too many people in the background.</li><li>You might have to completely remove the background of an image and use it for any other purpose.</li><li>Chances are that you might want to use your photo for a professional task, and its background could not be so appealing.</li><li>There could be any other creative reason for you to remove the background of a photo and apply any other layer instead.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Online-Photo-Background-Changers"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Online-Photo-Background-Changers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers"></a>Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers</h2><p>If you are looking for a reliable online photo background changer tool, then you can consider exploring the following solutions:</p><h4 id="2-Remove-BG"><a href="#2-Remove-BG" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove BG"></a>2. Remove BG</h4><p>Remove BG is a perfect photo background changer tool that is extremely easy to use. Once the photo is uploaded, it will automatically detect human figures and will remove its background. You can then add any other background of your choice – texture, bold colors, customized images, and so on. If you want, you can freely download the image for 0.25 megapixels, but to download an HD image, you have to pay one credit per photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-removebg.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer removebg"                ></p><h4 id="3-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#3-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="3. Adobe Spark"></a>3. Adobe Spark</h4><p>If you are looking for a hassle-free solution to change a photo’s background, then you can also try Adobe Spark. The online tool is powered by Adobe and will let you upload any JPG or PNG photos. Afterward, the application will remove the background of the image and will let you save it as a PNG file that you can overlap on any background of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-spark.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer spark"                ></p><h4 id="4-Wondershare-PixCut"><a href="#4-Wondershare-PixCut" class="headerlink" title="4. Wondershare PixCut"></a>4. Wondershare PixCut</h4><p>Developed by Wondershare, PixCut is a free online background changer tool that you can use on any browser. To use it, you just have to go to its official website and simply upload any photo. Now, the online tool would automatically remove the background of your photo with its smart AI features. Later, PixCut will let you save the file in the PNG format that you can edit on any application on your system or mobile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wondershare-pixcut.jpg"                      alt="wondershare pixcut"                ></p><h4 id="5-Slazzer-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#5-Slazzer-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="5. Slazzer Photo Background Remover"></a>5. Slazzer Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Slazzer has come up with a wide range of utility tools, including an online photo background changer. The tool supports PNG and JPG files and would let you automatically remove the background of an image. Its AI features can automatically detect all the popular figures like human faces, cars, trees, pets, and so on. However, using Slazzer, you can only remove the background of an image and would have to insert a new background on another tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-slazzer.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer slazzer"                ></p><h4 id="6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer"><a href="#6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="6. Fotor Photo Background Changer"></a>6. Fotor Photo Background Changer</h4><p>Fotor offers a couple of online features related to photo editing and this one is another smart tool that you can use on its website. The image background changer is easy to use, can remove the background of any photo, and let you replace it with a new one. While it offers some of the most advanced features for online image editing, the application is not available for free (and would cost around $8.99 per month).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-fotor.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer fotor"                ></p><h4 id="7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover"></a>7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Clip Magic also offers a smart and quick solution to change the background of an image online. Once the photo is loaded to the online application, it will let you get rid of the background easily (without any technical hassle). Apart from that, you can also use its smart editor to make all kinds of minor changes to your photos easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-clip-magic.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer clip magic"                ></p><h4 id="8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover"><a href="#8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover"></a>8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover</h4><p>As the name suggests, this is a freely available image editor that can also be used to change a photo’s background. Since it is an online tool, you can use it on any website without downloading anything on your system. Once the photo is manually uploaded, the application will automatically detect a figure (like a human face, car, or any other object). It will now crop the area of the figure and would remove its background, letting you change it later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-edit-photos.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer edit photos"                ></p><h4 id="9-Foco-Clipping"><a href="#9-Foco-Clipping" class="headerlink" title="9.

One of the best things about this online tool is that it can remove the background of multiple images at the same time. You can upload your photos in a bulk, let it process them, and remove their background. The image background changer is known for its exceptional results for cropping human figures with precise body and hair scaling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-foco.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer foco"                ></p><h4 id="10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer"><a href="#10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="10.PicsArt Image Background Changer"></a>10.PicsArt Image Background Changer</h4><p>The online photo background changer by PicsArt is quite easy to use and offers a wide range of features.

The short answer is pretty well: the accompanying app and software are intuitive and powerful, the video quality is good, and the overall user experience is great. But, for many people, this little device isn’t the best option, or even an option. For one thing, the round shape is a little awkward, and doesn’t fit conveniently in a pocket to carry it around. More importantly, the Gear 360 is only supported on Samsung phones. Yes, that’s right, unless you have a pretty recent Samsung phone, you’re out of luck on this one. Other concerns from users include the poor microphone quality, and the visible stitch lines in the picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/samsung-gear-360-camera.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Gear 360 "                ></p><p> If the Gear 360 isn’t the right choice for your 360-degree camera needs, just what is? Luckily, there are lots of other models out there. Let’s look at five of the best.</p><h2 id="Top-5-Samsung-Gear-360-Camera-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Top-5-Samsung-Gear-360-Camera-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Samsung Gear 360 Camera Alternatives"></a>Top 5 Samsung Gear 360 Camera Alternatives</h2><h3 id="1-360fly"><a href="#1-360fly" class="headerlink" title="1. 360fly"></a>1. 360fly</h3><p> Let’s start with the 360fly. This model is tough, being waterproof, dustproof, and shock proof. This makes it a great choice for use outdoors, and when travelling. It can be controlled using an iOS app, or with the included Bluetooth remote. It is also able to live stream footage, so that you can see it as you shoot. However, the video quality is not the best, and there can be some aberrations in color at the edges of the shot. Another issue that some users complain about is the that it offers only 32 GB of internal storage, with no way to extend it. It retails around $500, and is solid, but not outstanding, camera.</p><p> Check this video to watch the 360fly 4k unboxing review:</p><h3 id="2-Nikon-Key-Mission-360"><a href="#2-Nikon-Key-Mission-360" class="headerlink" title="2. Nikon Key Mission 360"></a>2. Nikon Key Mission 360</h3><p> Due to be released in the fall, Nikon’s Key Mission 360 will be a contender at a similar price point to the 360fly; it’s expected to retail for $499. This pocket sized device is meant to be rugged. It’s dustproof, shockproof, and waterproof to 100 ft. This camera will have two lenses to supply the 360-degree image and be used through a related app with a simple interface. Expectations are high for this offering, and it just might be worth waiting for if you need a camera that can take whatever you throw at it.</p><p> See more details about Nikon Key Mission 360 camera from this video:</p><h3 id="3-Bublcam"><a href="#3-Bublcam" class="headerlink" title="3. Bublcam"></a>3. Bublcam</h3><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bublcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses 4 lenses to ensure a 360-degree view in every direction, with no blind spots. Retailing around $800, it’s one of the more expensive consumer grade VR cameras, but makes up for it by offering 1080p video and high quality photos. The spherical camera has some motion-activated stabilization, meant to keep shaky camera work from ruining your perfect shots. It has a microSD card slot, allowing you to add storage. Unfortunately, the microphone quality is not great, but if you’re relatively close to the camera, it should be pretty clear. Unlike the 360fly, the Bublcam is pretty small, fitting comfortably into the palm of your hand, or a jacket pocket. The camera also ships with a small tripod, which is extremely handy for taking good shots.</p><p> Bublcam’s unboxing review:</p><h3 id="4-Ricoh-Theta-S"><a href="#4-Ricoh-Theta-S" class="headerlink" title="4. Ricoh Theta S"></a>4. Ricoh Theta S</h3><p> If that’s a little outside of your price range, and you want something more pocket-sized, consider the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Ricoh Theta S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Retailing at just $350, it’s one of the less expensive camera in our line-up. It has exactly one button for starting and stopping video or image capture, and two bubble eye lenses on opposite sides of the camera. It allows live streaming via mini-HDMI, and has an phone app that can be used to control the camera. The video quality is only average, but this is an excellent choice for the casual 360-degree camera user.</p><p> Wanna know where to Ricoh Theta S, check this video below:</p><h3 id="5-LG360-cam"><a href="#5-LG360-cam" class="headerlink" title="5. LG360 cam"></a>5. LG360 cam</h3><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >LG360 cam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a new offering in the bargain 360-degree cameras. Retailing at only $180, it is comparable in cost to a reasonably good digital camera. This camera is very compact, and connects to your phone with an app, available for both Android and iOS, that allows you to preview&#x2F;review your shots and control the camera. It also allows you to shoot with only one lens at a time, for a 180-degree image.</p><p> All of that said, there are some downsides to this little bargain. The first is that you’ll have to buy a microSD card for storage. The camera requires one, and does not have one included. Another problem is viewing your photos. The camera must transfer files to your phone before they can be viewed, which can take a while, and does not support editing. While you can transfer files to the computer and edit them, this makes the stitching more obvious and you’ll likely have to use some stitching software to clean it up after. Since the LG cam is designed to be a Shoot and Share type camera, it’s better not to try to edit. The image quality is not great, which isn’t unexpected for the price, but it’s a great entry point for new 360-degree camera users, especially ones who just want to experience the technology, without breaking the bank.</p><p> Check a detailed review about LG360 Cam from this video</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> While the Samsung Gear 360 is a nice camera, it, like all of its 360-degree camera brethren, has its shortcomings. For many people, the most problematic is that it’s only compatible with Samsung phones. Fortunately, the above options are largely compatible with any phone, and offer a variety of prices, image quality, and functionality. Since professional grade 360-degree cameras still cost to the tune of $60000, I think I’ll be sticking to one of these inexpensive models, regardless of some of their flaws.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-creating-conversation-a-guide-for-active-youtubers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Creating Conversation  A Guide for Active YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-maximizing-creativity-find-your-next-project-on-these-top-12-photo-websites-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Maximizing Creativity - Find Your Next Project on These Top 12 Photo Websites for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-adding-accurate-dates-to-photographic-records/"><u>2024 Approved  Adding Accurate Dates to Photographic Records</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-10plus-list-of-online-church-streaming-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate 10+ List of Online Church Streaming for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfect-zoom-optimizing-kinemasters-viewer-engagement/"><u>In 2024, Perfect Zoom  Optimizing Kinemaster's Viewer Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-10-accessory-collection-for-sj4000-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate 10 Accessory Collection for SJ4000 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/elevate-your-content-delivery-from-zoom-to-fb-live-streaming-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Content Delivery  From Zoom to FB Live Streaming for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/mastering-podcasts-the-comprehensive-iphone-download-method-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Podcasts  The Comprehensive iPhone Download Method for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-free-downloaders-download-youtube-thumbnail-for-freeonlinewinmac/"><u>In 2024, Best Free Downloaders  Download YouTube Thumbnail for Free[Online/Win/Mac]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/play-store-not-working-on-motorola-edge-40-pro-8-solutions-inside-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Not Working On Motorola Edge 40 Pro? 8 Solutions Inside | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/oppo-f23-5g-camera-not-working-unexpected-error-fix-it-now-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Oppo F23 5G Camera Not Working Unexpected Error?

One of the most talked about features includes <strong>iPhone X Face ID</strong> security option which helps in unlocking the device with just recognizing the user’s face. However, Android has also introduced this sort of security lock with <strong>Samsung’s face recognition</strong>. Both the companies are remarkable with their own enhancement and technologies and claims to be the best for this face recognition technology. We therefore have appeared here with a thorough analysis of both devices’ face recognition capability. Let’s master what’s the difference between both.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How does it work?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Which one is more Accuracy?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: The Common Inconvenience</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Safety Issue</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-does-it-work"><a href="#Part-1-How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How does it work?"></a>Part 1: How does it work?</h2><p> This section will cover how the face recognition technology works for both the devices. Check out the process.</p><p> iPhone X:</p><p> While talking about latest iPhone, the company has designed the face detection function with a range of advanced sensors which include dot projector, infrared camera flood illuminator etc. The first component holds the capability to scrutinize the user’s face using TrueDepth camera. The camera captures in-depth face via more than 30,000 invisible dots in order to get the accurate and distinctive 3D facial map. This way, any kind of movement of your face will not stop the device to detect it before unlocking. When the dot pattern completes, the Infrared camera takes an infrared photo of the face. Once this gets done, an A11 Bionic chip’s neural engine helps in transforming the detailing and infrared face for meticulous precisions and confirming the enrolled face by comparing all the corrections. The A11 chip comes with full protection and is protected with secure Enclave.</p><p> The flood illuminator aims at infrared flash for enabling the face recognition technology to detect the face no matter what the surrounding light is. Putting differently, your face can be recognized even in dim light since your face is been recorded through infrared light.</p><p> Samsung:</p><p> Samsung also uses almost identical operation and involves two components which are IR LED and Iris camera. The former can be said as similar to the flood illuminator of the newest iPhone. IR LED works same as flood illuminator. It however shows difference only by focusing the infrared light on the eyes unlike flood illuminator which focus on the entire face. The Iris camera is nothing but infrared camera whose job is to take the picture of your iris. The process begins with IR LED which assists Iris camera by illuminating the eyes so that the camera gets the opportunity to capture the iris pattern properly. Samsung has the option to choose between both iris scanning or just one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Face-Unlock.jpg"                      alt="Samsung"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Which-one-is-more-Accuracy"><a href="#Part-2-Which-one-is-more-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Which one is more Accuracy?"></a>Part 2: Which one is more Accuracy?</h2><p> Being accurate is a considerable issue with face recognition technology if you are using a Samsung device. On the other hand, iPhone X shows accuracy than Samsung since it analyzes the whole face instead of iris. For Samsung’s iris scanner, the camera contains a confined and narrowly designed focus where is exactly your iris needed to be for scanning. The camera will able to recognize only when your iris will be in that same place for long where it focuses. And therefore, there are times when you left with holding your device high for better iris detection. Apple has no such accuracy issue for it takes your face to recognize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-accuracy.jpg"                      alt="iPhone X accuracy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-The-Common-Inconvenience"><a href="#Part-3-The-Common-Inconvenience" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: The Common Inconvenience"></a>Part 3: The Common Inconvenience</h2><p> When it comes to practicality, we would state that both the phone don’t stand well for it. This is because if you use Apple’s latest invention i.e. iPhone X, you are required to first hold your device in your hand followed by looking at the screen. Then you need to swipe it up for unlocking the device.</p><p> On the other hand, when you are Samsung owner, you need to open your eyes accurately and stare the screen and the distance between the device and eyes ideally should be an arm length.</p><p> Both the devices need to be lifted to keep the face’s angle point accurately and it can look awkward when you need to use your device in a crowded place. Hence, both ways are kind of inconvenient to use especially when you wish to use your device secretly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/face-incovenience.jpg"                      alt="face ID incovenience"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Safety-Issue"><a href="#Part-4-Safety-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Safety Issue"></a>Part 4: Safety Issue</h2><p> Ensuring safety is one of the main concern people have and the face recognition technology in both the devices has done pretty well. Apple uses the TrueDepth camera system which includes flood illuminator, IR camera as well as dot projector to make the face recognized in all possible ways. It has been claimed by the company that the possibility of unlocking the device by a random person’s face is 1 in 1,000,000. Besides this, Apple had made sure to let people try only 5 face attempts after which they will require to enter the passcode. The probability though doesn’t work same for twins and the family members who resemble you. Also, the children who are less than 13 are able to trick you since they don’t have fully developed facial features.</p><p> Besides this, Apple has also made the newest model intelligent enough to not get fooled by any 2D photo or any other 2D mediums. Before releasing high-quality face recognition technology, Apple tested how the feature reacts with life-like masks and other techniques that can give rise to deceiving. To its surprise, the device got positive results and the Face ID has the ability to not get trapped by masks and the like things.</p><p> The Face ID by Apple in its iPhone X also makes itself proficient enough to detect the modifications in the appearances such as growing of beard or if a lady has applied makeup. Or if you have shaved your beard fully, the device takes a confirmation with the help of a passcode. What’s more, you don’t have to worry if you are wearing scarf or shades, cap, hat and even contact lenses, Face ID will work properly with the accessories too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/face-id-issue.jpg"                      alt="face ID issue"                ></p><p> On the other hand, Samsung also doesn’t lag behind when it comes to safety and security with face recognition feature. Samsung is the first Android device company to introduce face recognition technology that brought iris scanning technology with its Galaxy Note 7. The technology does it job by detecting the iris’ pattern of your eyes. As far as security is concerned, the technology gets 10 on 10 since each person possesses unique iris pattern and it becomes difficult to replicate. The devices by Samsung having face recognition technology are designed with infrared diode which is capable</p><p> All in all, both the companies have put extra effort in justifying the safety with trending face recognition technology. However, we are not certain for full reliability of them.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> The technology of facial recognition isn’t new to us and it has made people excited from the time it has come. However, many users have not started using the technology yet. We hope that this functionality will gain the popularity with time and people will start to make use of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-fade-to-darkness-instantaneously/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Fade to Darkness Instantaneously</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-high-speed-action-analysis-hero5-vs-star/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, High-Speed Action Analysis  Hero5 Vs Star</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-pull-the-right-strings-increasing-likes-on-unboxed-tiktoks/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Pull the Right Strings  Increasing Likes on Unboxed TikToks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-elevating-your-photos-using-photoshops-radial-toolkit/"><u>[Updated] Elevating Your Photos Using Photoshop's Radial Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-finding-cost-effective-buys-on-gopros/"><u>[Updated] Finding Cost-Effective Buys on GoPros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-psychology-behind-effective-interviews/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Psychology Behind Effective Interviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/optimal-camera-balance-for-drone-use-for-2024/"><u>Optimal Camera Balance for Drone Use for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-maximize-screen-size-for-youtube-videos/"><u>[Updated] Maximize Screen Size for YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-best-4k-monitors-for-video-editing/"><u>In 2024, 9 Best 4K Monitors for Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-leading-windows-call-platforms-7-1-ranked/"><u>[New] In 2024, Leading Windows Call Platforms  #7-#1 Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-proven-pc-strategies-elevating-video-quality-and-engagement-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Proven PC Strategies  Elevating Video Quality and Engagement on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-budget-desktop-encoder-hacks-and-tips/"><u>[New] Budget Desktop Encoder Hacks and Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/advanced-methods-for-effortless-recording-of-your-google-classes/"><u>Advanced Methods for Effortless Recording of Your Google Classes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/get-started-with-microsoft-video-editor-easy-video-editing-for-windows-users/"><u>Get Started with Microsoft Video Editor Easy Video Editing for Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-video-joiner-not-cutting-it-explore-these-10-powerful-alternatives/"><u>In 2024, Easy Video Joiner Not Cutting It?

The latest edition to the Windows family was rolled out on July 29th, and those who have been able to make the upgrade have had some pretty nice things to say about it. Time will ultimately tell if Windows 10 is really going to be a hit, but early indications point to that being the case.</p><p>If you’re still waiting for the go-ahead from Microsoft to download Windows 10 free, then you at least have some time to look at some of the Windows 10 features.</p><h4 id="1-Top-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#1-Top-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="1. Top Windows 10 Features"></a>1. Top Windows 10 Features</h4><p>With Windows 10, it would seem as though Microsoft actually listened to people. The improvements to Windows 10 are vast, when you compare them to Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. We all know by now just how unpopular Windows 8 and 8.1 were. Some people even decided to stick with Windows 7 instead.</p><p>Microsoft is clearly looking to bring the world at large on board with Windows 10. To that end, they have brought a number of exciting features to the table:</p><p><strong>Cortana Virtual Assistant</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is one of the biggest features Microsoft is rolling out for the Windows 10. If you have been using the Windows Phone, then you already have an idea of what to expect from the tablet&#x2F;PC version. This digital assistant is designed to be vastly superior to Siri or Google Now. You’ll find Cortana next to your desktop’s start button, but you can also say “Hey, Cortana” to bring it to life. You remain in complete control of how much Cortana knows about you, but you’ll definitely love the way Cortana can bring up requested information instantly. Early users have also noted that Cortana is more than capable of maintaining a full, almost-natural conversational flow.</p><p><strong>Edge Web Browser</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edge.jpg"                      alt="edge"                ></p><p>Say goodbye to Internet Explorer. The long-disliked browser is finally being chucked aside, in favor of something that will strive to be decidedly different. Although IE will still support legacy software, Edge is clearly the one taking center stage as the default browser for Windows 10. Features will include a screen grabbing tool that offers touchscreen sketching capabilities, a reading mode, and even a notepad. Search results will be built around your preferences, and you will have the ability as well to get restaurant information or directions shot to you in an instant.</p><p><strong>Windows 10 Start Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>No one really liked the start menu layout for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Windows 10 offers a fantastic improvement to that end. If the start menu looks quite familiar, that’s because Microsoft has made it a point to bring back the style virtually all of us prefer. Yet Windows 10 will have some decided differences. The start menu will allow you to look over frequently-used apps, use the universal search without swiping, and yes, the tiles will be there, as well. However, you will be able to control how prominent they are.</p><p>These are just three of the new features of Windows 10. Ready to learn about a few more?</p><h4 id="2-More-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#2-More-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="2. More Windows 10 Features"></a>2. More Windows 10 Features</h4><p>The above three features are good examples of what Windows 10 will bring to the table, but that’s not it by a long shot:</p><p><strong>Xbox App and Streaming</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/xboy-games-windows10-1.png"                      alt="xbox games windows10"                ></p><p>Windows 10 will include an exciting Xbox app, which will come loaded with possibilities. The Xbox app will give you the ability to control your Xbox One, but you’ll also be able to utilize your DVR capture for your Windows games. Even more exciting is the way you’ll have the ability to play multiplayer titles across between your Xbox One and your PC. With the streaming side of things, Windows 10 will allow you to stream titles from your Xbox Box. There will also be DirectX 12 support.</p><p> <strong>Universal Apps</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/universal_apps.jpg"                      alt="universal_apps"                ></p><p>If you’re going to use Windows 10 across several different devices, you’re going to love this aspect. Photos, Music, Video, Map, People, and other apps will be available across all your devices. Furthermore, Windows 10 will ensure that your apps will look and function the same, regardless of the app you’re using.</p><p> <strong>Design and Interface Improvements</strong></p><p>There is a cohesiveness and consistency to everything that is going to make Windows 10 a highly pleasant experience for most of the people who use it.

We capture multiple images of the same subject or a scene with slightly different exposure and then mix all the images into a final perfect photograph.</p><p>A portrait is one of the most liked genres of photography, especially on the occasions of weddings, get-togethers, meet-ups, and many more. A good portrait photograph can capture a person’s detailed personality and emotions.</p><p>The camera can perform fantastic functions, but it is still a machine at the end of the day, and its sensors have limitations. But by the HDR technique, you can create a scene closer to what the human eye sees.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn how to shoot and create impressive HDR portraits, whether a beginner or a professional. We have written about creating both still and moving HDR portraits in an easy way.</p><p>People often find it challenging to shoot a perfect HDR photograph from a phone camera. In this tutorial, we will answer some common questions on how to create an impressive HDR portrait. So let’s get started.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Still HDR Portraits</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Some Useful Tips to Remember</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">HDR Effects on Phone Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">Moving HDR Portraits?</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Edit and Merge Images to Create an HDR Portrait?</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot HDR Portraits?"></a>How to Shoot HDR Portraits?</h2><p>HDR portraits are best captured when your subject is still and the camera is also fixed on a tripod. So first, we will talk about how to shoot still portraits and then moving portraits.</p><h3 id="Still-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#Still-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Still HDR Portraits"></a>Still HDR Portraits</h3><p>You can create a high-quality HDR portrait by following these simple steps.</p><h5 id="Step1Camera-Setting"><a href="#Step1Camera-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Step1Camera Setting"></a>Step1Camera Setting</h5><p>The first and most crucial part of your camera setting is to choose between two modes, i.e., manual or aperture mode. We have compared these two below so you can choose whichever way fits your situation.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Manual mode</strong></th><th><strong>Aperture Mode</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>In manual mode, you can control both aperture and shutter speed and select any desired value.</td><td>In this mode, you just have to select your desired aperture value, like <em>f</em>&#x2F;2.0 or <em>f</em>&#x2F;1.8, and the camera will automatically pick the suitable shutter speed.</td></tr><tr><td>It can be used when the lighting conditions are intense and constant, and you have plenty of time to think and adjust the exposure.</td><td>Useful when the light conditions are changing rapidly. It selects the best suitable exposure itself and has the advantage of speed.</td></tr><tr><td>You have more control over your camera settings.</td><td>The camera itself matches the aperture value with the appropriate shutter speed.</td></tr><tr><td>Suitable for professionals.</td><td>Suitable for beginners.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-1.jpg"                      alt="camera setting"                ></p><p>So it is your choice which mode you want to use. Both work perfectly with HDR photography.</p><h5 id="Step2Bracketing"><a href="#Step2Bracketing" class="headerlink" title="Step2Bracketing"></a>Step2Bracketing</h5><p>HDR photography uses the technique of bracketing in which multiple shots of the same subject are taken using different camera contrast settings and then merging these images to get a final result.</p><p>You can take numerous pictures manually by selecting a new exposure after every photo. Still, it is very time-consuming, and the chances of the subject moving during the shoot also increase.</p><p>So almost all DSLRs come with this beneficial feature of bracketing. You can check the user manual of your device to activate this feature. For some devices, it is started by a single click, while in some, it is hidden deep in the menu. Once you start it, you have to select the number of images you want to take and the increase in exposure after every snap.</p><p>Usually, three shots are ideal for HDR portraits as the chances of moving decrease. Nowadays, many latest DSLRs have the option of automatic exposure bracketing as it provides the photographer with different levels of exposure in a single click without spending valuable time adjusting camera settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-2.jpg"                      alt="moving decrease"                ></p><p>Once you are done with your bracketing settings, all you have to do is press and hold the shutter, and your specified number of photos will be taken, each with a different exposure value.</p><h3 id="Some-Useful-Tips-to-Remember"><a href="#Some-Useful-Tips-to-Remember" class="headerlink" title="Some Useful Tips to Remember"></a>Some Useful Tips to Remember</h3><ol><li><strong>Try to Keep the Subject Still</strong></li></ol><p>HDR portrait shooting takes time as you have to take 3-5 images of your subject. So you have to keep your subject still in every frame; otherwise, your final image will not be good.</p><p>To avoid moving, you can give them some support to lean on, like a wall, or ask them to sit on a chair.</p><ol><li><strong>Avoid Shaking the Camera</strong></li></ol><p>Same is the case for your camera. You have to use a tripod stand to avoid camera shaking.</p><ol><li><strong>Autofocus should be OFF</strong></li></ol><p>You should adjust the focus manually instead of autofocus, as it may shift the focus accidentally while pressing the shutter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-3.jpg"                      alt="autofocus should be off"                ></p><h3 id="HDR-Effects-on-Phone-Camera"><a href="#HDR-Effects-on-Phone-Camera" class="headerlink" title="HDR Effects on Phone Camera"></a>HDR Effects on Phone Camera</h3><p>Of course, everyone can’t use a DSLR camera for shooting HDR portraits as the process is a bit difficult and requires some expertise. But you can achieve the same effects on your mobile phone. Many latest mobiles offer HDR features in their camera. Unlike the bracketing effect of professional cameras, mobile usually takes only one picture and then you can edit by using some third-party app. Hundreds of these photo editing apps allow you to change the brightness and contrast of your image to create a <em>“pseudo”</em> HDR image.</p><p>Now that you know how to shoot still HDR portraits, let’s put some light on shooting HDR moving portraits.</p><h3 id="Moving-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#Moving-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Moving HDR Portraits?"></a>Moving HDR Portraits?</h3><p>People usually ask, “ <em>Can I shoot moving subjects in HDR?</em>“ or “<em>What is the basic method to get sharp-looking HDR photos of moving people?</em>“</p><p>Shooting moving portraits in HDR can get a bit difficult because of blurring and exposure issues. But you don’t need to worry because here are some of the effective solutions for recording moving HDR portraits.</p><p><strong>Solution 1.</strong> You can use two DSLRs with the same lens and set them so that the difference in the viewing angle is minimum.</p><p><strong>Solution 2.</strong> Using RAW files you can get a dynamic range of exposures that you wouldn’t be able to get with a JPEG file.</p><p><strong>Solution 3.</strong> DSLRs with high-quality exposure and depth sensors can also help shoot HDR moving portraits.</p><h2 id="How-to-Edit-and-Merge-Images-to-Create-an-HDR-Portrait"><a href="#How-to-Edit-and-Merge-Images-to-Create-an-HDR-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit and Merge Images to Create an HDR Portrait?"></a>How to Edit and Merge Images to Create an HDR Portrait?</h2><p>After you have shot the images, the next step is to merge and edit them on photoshop or any other software to create a single perfect portrait.</p><h5 id="Step1Merging-the-Images"><a href="#Step1Merging-the-Images" class="headerlink" title="Step1Merging the Images"></a>Step1Merging the Images</h5><p>Hundreds of editing software are available but here we are going to talk about photoshop as it is used worldwide and is user-friendly.</p><ul><li>First, when you open Photoshop, go to <strong>Files &gt;</strong> <strong>Automate &gt; Merge to HDR pro,</strong> Or click on <strong>Tools &gt; Photoshop &gt; Merge to HDR pro</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-4.jpg"                      alt="tools photoshop merge to hdr pro"                ></p><ul><li>Click on <strong>Browse</strong> and select the images you want to merge.</li><li>Before clicking the OK button, you can tick on the <strong>Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images</strong> option so that minor artifacts introduced while shooting the images can be removed by photoshop.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-5.jpg"                      alt="removed by photoshop"                ></p><ul><li>After the images are loaded, a dialogue box will appear on the right side with all the tools you need to edit your HDR portrait.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-6.jpg"                      alt="edit hdr portrait"                ></p><ul><li>Tick on the option of <strong>Remove ghosts</strong> to avoid any halos in the editing process.</li><li>For regular HDR portraits, select <strong>16 Bit</strong> mode in the first section.</li><li>The second section is <strong>Edge Glow</strong>. If you want a natural-looking portrait photo, you should decrease the <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Radius</strong> levels; otherwise, you can increase them according to your need.</li><li>Next, you have the <strong>Tone and Detail</strong> Reducing the <strong>Gamma</strong> adds more contrast to your image and vice versa. <strong>Exposure</strong> is simply the brightness of the image. The <strong>Detail</strong> option adds an HDR effect to your image, but you should avoid over-detailing as it may ruin the natural look of your portrait.</li><li>Finally, there is the option of <strong>Advanced</strong> and <strong>Curve,</strong> in which you can adjust the levels of <strong>Shadow</strong>, <strong>Highlights</strong>, <strong>Vibrance,</strong> and <strong>Saturation</strong> of your image.</li></ul><p>Once you are done with all the adjustments, you’ll finally have your perfect HDR portrait.</p><h5 id="Step2Editing-the-Portrait"><a href="#Step2Editing-the-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="Step2Editing the Portrait"></a>Step2Editing the Portrait</h5><p>If you are not satisfied with your resulting portrait image, you can further edit it in Lightroom or Photoshop.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>HDR portraits are way better than conventional portrait images as they bring out the photograph’s fine details that are impossible to achieve otherwise.</p><p>It is not as difficult as it seems to shoot an HDR portrait.

The file size is unknown until you have the completed produced video. The terms 20MB and 20Mb are not interchangeable.</p><p>The problem is that a 30-second iPhone recording might easily exceed 100MB in size. 1024 MB or less than 20 minutes. What is the length of a video that is 25 megabytes?</p><p>At 30 frames per second, a raw HD video will require 5MBx30 150MB of storage space. Does anyone know how many MB a 30-second VGA video at 30 frames per second would take up on a memory stick?</p><p> For the raw footage, we’ll need roughly 540GB per hour.</p><p>Bits per second (bps) is the unit of measurement for network transmissions. Even if you have a premium Nitro account, you cannot upload long videos larger than 20MB. - 1080p video size: 258 MB</p><p>As a result, 20MBps is 160Mbps. 1024 bytes per kilobyte. I’d have to look into what kind of file that is.</p><p>How long does a 25MB video last? Each uncompressed frame is approximately 5MB in size.</p><p>Once you have the file size, all you have to do is guess how many times it will be seen. The video file size formula can now be used to address how to compute video file size. TVs that stream video.</p><p>A DVD with excellent quality content holds 47 gigabytes, or little more than 2. I’m using a laptop as a projector, but I also need it to connect to a second TV. 8 Mbps Youtube HD 1080p25</p><p>30 frames per second vs 15 fps. Depending on the aforementioned, a 30-second video could be anywhere from 1 to 30 megabytes. The 400 MB video file will download in less than 11 minutes over a. - 25 Mb seconds.</p><p>If the video is only 2 or 3 minutes long, you should be able to compress the file size significantly. That means one frame in a 4K video file with an 8-bit Bit Depth is 84375 MB in size. Alternatively, 20Mbps is 25MBps.</p><p>That is 20 megabits per second. As a result, many people worry if they can transfer large films through Discord without Nitro. The LG smart television turns on for a few seconds before turning off.</p><p>Many of our storage drives are incapable of writing to disk at that speed. Seconds of 20MB video When I try to edit my video in a video editor, it claims that the resolution is not supported. As a result, 1 minute 60 seconds.</p><p>So 70778880 bits &#x3D; 84375 MB (8 x 1024 × 1024 MB). What is the maximum video length that can be uploaded on Facebook? 25md is equal to how many seconds of video.</p><p>- 1 minute, 25-megabyte video. How many megabytes are there? 3200 Mb 5 Mbps download time</p><p>A minute is equal to 60 seconds. I make 30 seconds 320 x 240 videos that are roughly 12 MB in size.</p><p><strong>How to create a longer video in a 20Mb video (introduce Filmora to change video bitrate or resolution to create a longer video)</strong></p><p>When exporting video, you may have come across the term “bitrate” on occasion. Then you’re probably wondering what bitrate is. Is it related to the quality of my video? Don’t be concerned. Many readers, including yourself, have similar reservations.</p><p>We will explain what video bitrate is and how video bitrate and quality are related in this article. Finally, we’ll show you how to alter the video bitrate as a bonus and have a longer video. Continue to read!</p><p><strong>What is the bitrate of the video?</strong></p><p>The entire amount of video data transferred in a given period is known as the video bitrate. To put it another way, each video file has its own set of data that must be sent in order to play it on multiple devices. Video bitrate is the pace at which this data is conveyed over a certain time interval. Video bitrate is usually expressed in bits per second (bps). It’s also important to remember that videos with a higher bitrate typically have a greater file size.</p><p><strong>Does higher video bitrate mean better video quality?</strong></p><p>When looking at the same video with the same resolution, a greater bitrate will accommodate higher image quality in the video output. Bitrates are projected to increase when the resolution is increased and more data is handled.</p><p>As a result, while a high video bitrate can give amazing quality, it can also put a lot of load on your hardware, causing stutters.</p><p><strong>How to change the bitrate of a video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Filmora can be used to change the bitrate of video files. It has a user-friendly interface and supports a wide range of media formats, allowing you to quickly and easily change the bitrate of your media files.</p><ul><li><strong>Import Video -Bring the video files in.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-many-seconds-video-1.jpg"                      alt="how-many-seconds-video-"                ></p><p>Run Video Editor after installing it.

It’s super portable, relatively affordable and with its 4K capability, it can take impressive Ultra HD and Full HD videos. As part of its selfie-inspired design, the Breeze comes with an app controller instead of a traditional radio controller. It can be activated from a smartphone and with a number of presets, it’s considerably easier to operate than larger camera drones. What’s more, videos and pictures can be downloaded and shared on social media within minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yuneec-breeze.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Complete-Review-for-Yuneec-Breeze-4K-Drone"><a href="#Complete-Review-for-Yuneec-Breeze-4K-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Complete Review for Yuneec Breeze 4K Drone"></a>Complete Review for Yuneec Breeze 4K Drone</h2><h3 id="Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons"></a>Pros and Cons</h3><p>The Breeze scores major points for camera strength and overall portability. It’s so well designed that in its compact plastic box, the Breeze can fit in a backpack or carryall tote. It comes with a 13MP camera that can take 4k – 4160 x 3120px UHD videos as well as still shots. And to top it off, the Breeze is very steady in the air and responds quite well to its app controller. On the downside, the Breeze has limited camera stabilization. This is because it uses digital stabilization instead of a gimbal. Furthermore, its digital stabilization does not work while it’s in 4K mode. This gives the Breeze limited 4K capability. Some users may opt for Full HD and HD shots since digital stabilization is active for resolutions lower than 4K. Also, seasoned drone fliers may find its app controller somewhat deficient compared to a radio controller with joysticks.</p><h3 id="Key-features"><a href="#Key-features" class="headerlink" title="Key features"></a>Key features</h3><p>The Yuneec Breeze is a quad drone built with brushless motors that power four foldable propellers. It’s equipped with GPS and maintains a good orientation when outdoors. It also has an Indoor Positioning System that enables it to maintain orientation and level when it’s used indoors. Its foldable propellers have a 5” diameter spin, and the Breeze comes with propeller guards to protect them from damage during indoor or outdoor use. The Breeze has impressive flight capability though it is clearly not designed for speed. It can rise to an altitude of over 250ft at a max climbing speed of 1m&#x2F;s. Overall, the Breeze is a slow camera drone and in its defence, this can be ideal for video capture and well-composed photos.</p><h3 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h3><p>The design of the Breeze is good enough for regular though careful use. It’s made of plastic that can withstand minor bumps and crashes. Though the Breeze retails for under $500, it’s still a significant expense. So, its overall durability is a very good thing. It’s worth mentioning however, that the white body color of the Breeze can make it difficult to visually track its movement. Contrasting body color makes a drone stand out against the brightness of the sky. Due to its color, the Breeze may be difficult to spot when it’s flown at max height in certain conditions. One very nice feature of the Breeze is that it has a failsafe that ensures it won’t go missing when the signal is lost. A drone can lose signal if the controller is out of range or out of power. In these situations, the Breeze is designed to hover in place for one minute and return to its take-off point where it shuts itself down.</p><h3 id="Battery-life-Flight-time"><a href="#Battery-life-Flight-time" class="headerlink" title="Battery life(Flight time)"></a>Battery life(Flight time)</h3><p>The Yuneec Breeze 4K Drone comes with two 1150mAh batteries that can power its flight for over 10 mins each. So, with the two batteries fully charged, a user can shoot videos and selfies for up to 20mins. While this isn’t record-breaking time, it’s still within the range for camera drones. The batteries can be recharged in 40-45 mins.</p><h3 id="Flight-performance-Modes-like-Orbit-Journey-Follow-me"><a href="#Flight-performance-Modes-like-Orbit-Journey-Follow-me" class="headerlink" title="Flight performance (Modes like Orbit, Journey, Follow me)"></a>Flight performance (Modes like Orbit, Journey, Follow me)</h3><p>As mentioned above, the Breeze is a slow-flying camera drone. Its slow and steady movement is designed to support its main function as a selfie drone. It also comes with more than 5 flight presets. First, there’s Pilot Mode which gives the user complete manual control of the Breeze. Then, there’s the Selfie Mode which lets the user set height and distance for the perfect aerial selfie. The Orbit Mode lets the Breeze orbit around a user or object for a 360o shot. One interesting preset is Journey Mode which lets a user set a flight path that begins and ends at the same point. When activated, the Breeze follows the path and while keeping the user within the camera’s frame, shoots a wide-angle video that slowly zooms in as it returns to its starting point. In ‘Follow Me’ mode, the Breeze tracks user movement via GPS.</p><h3 id="Control-range"><a href="#Control-range" class="headerlink" title="Control range"></a>Control range</h3><p>The Breeze is controlled through an app over a Wi-fi network. Its control range is over 100ft in distance and more than 200ft in altitude. However, as expected, the signal gets weaker the farther the drone moves from the controller. Most testers agree that the Wi-fi connection between the drone and the app is good. Besides, because of the drone’s failsafe, there’s little to fear if the signal is interrupted.</p><h3 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h3><p>The camera on the Breeze can take 4K videos from over 200ft in the air. However, the Breeze uses digital stabilization instead of a gimbal to ensure that camera footage is steady. Its digital stabilization is also limited to Full HD (1920 x 1080px) and lower resolutions. This means that a 4K footage from the Breeze may get unsteady or wobbly if the wind picks up. Overall, videos and photos from the Breeze are great for social media like Instagram and Facebook.</p><h3 id="APP"><a href="#APP" class="headerlink" title="APP"></a>APP</h3><p>The app for the Breeze is available for both iOS and Android phones. The app shows virtual joysticks which can be used to move the drone around and orient the camera as needed. While it is as effective as can be expected for virtual joysticks, most testers agree the app offers significantly less precision than radio joysticks. On the upside, the controlling app makes it easy to see your footage from the drone. The camera’s live feed is shown in the background while the virtual joysticks are active on the smartphone screen. This makes adjusting the drone’s position or camera much easier.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Yuneec-Breeze-Flying-Camera-Definition/dp/B01LANE77M" >Buy from Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The Yuneec Breeze 4K Drone is a good option for people who take selfies seriously. It has 16GB of inbuilt memory that can be accessed via a USB cable and with its app controller, users are only a few clicks from sharing their amazing shots with the world. All in all, the Breeze is a solid selfie drone that should be flown carefully since it lacks the ability to detect and avoid obstacles. Also, fans of the Breeze may find it worthwhile to invest in additional batteries to prolong usage time beyond its 20min limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/capturing-the-moment-masterful-techniques-for-excellent-edits-for-2024/"><u>Capturing the Moment  Masterful Techniques for Excellent Edits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-shooting-hdr-iphones-pathway-to-enhanced-images/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Shooting HDR  IPhone's Pathway to Enhanced Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-metaverse-advertising-techniques/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Mastering Metaverse Advertising Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unleash-potential-understanding-and-altering-account-numbers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unleash Potential  Understanding and Altering Account Numbers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-pulse-of-persuasion-adding-dynamic-text-to-insta-stories/"><u>[New] Pulse of Persuasion  Adding Dynamic Text to Insta Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-how-augmentation-changes-our-reality-view/"><u>[New] How Augmentation Changes Our Reality View</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevate-your-unboxing-game-to-next-level/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevate Your Unboxing Game to Next Level</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-7-essential-secrets-for-delectable-cooking-clips/"><u>In 2024, 7 Essential Secrets for Delectable Cooking Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-extracting-youtube-songs-safely-a-free-guide-explored/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Extracting YouTube Songs Safely  A Free Guide Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-11-budget-friendly-creativity-for-youtube-names/"><u>[Updated] Unlock 11 Budget-Friendly Creativity for YouTube Names</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/mystical-camera-pause-strategies/"><u>Mystical Camera Pause Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/unveiling-sms-secrets-top-whatsapp-tricks-revealed/"><u>Unveiling SMS Secrets  Top WhatsApp Tricks Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/in-2024-free-and-easy-the-most-overlooked-speech-recognition-apps-for-mac/"><u>In 2024, Free & Easy The Most Overlooked Speech Recognition Apps for Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/trouble-with-iphone-8-swipe-up-try-these-11-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Trouble with iPhone 8 Swipe-Up?
