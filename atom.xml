Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV-1"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV-1" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe-1"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.</p><p>There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:</p><ol><li><strong>Palm Detection</strong>: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.</li><li><strong>Hand Landmarks Identification</strong>: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/20-hand-landmarks-for-identifiction-hand-tracking.jpg"                      alt="20 hand landmarks for identifiction – hand tracking"                ></p><h3 id="Guidance-With-Steps-1"><a href="#Guidance-With-Steps-1" class="headerlink" title="Guidance With Steps"></a>Guidance With Steps</h3><p>Before starting to create Hand Tracking, you need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" >Pycharm IDE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>app on your PC.

Is it worth buying a camcorder?"></a>1. Is it worth buying a camcorder?</h3><p>One of the biggest reasons for buying camcorders is the lens. With DSLRs and mirrorless cameras coming to the forefront, people doubt the credibility of a camcorder. But camcorders have powerful and long zoom lenses with tiny imaging sensors, which makes it more powerful than any DSLR. It also comes with variable speed zoom control that can create smooth, slow zooms to reveal and introduce a location, or quick punch-ins to highlight the action. There are no limits in recording time with camcorders, which makes it ideal for event photography. Camcorders can be plugged into the socket to continue with videography when batteries are exhausted and have dedicated dials for adjusting volume levels. Therefore, camcorders are a better and worthy purchase.</p><h3 id="2-What-camcorder-do-YouTubers-use"><a href="#2-What-camcorder-do-YouTubers-use" class="headerlink" title="2.

Do you want to fade in or out your video to black or white? Then, we have got you. Adobe Premiere Pro is one popular video editing software. Fading is every editor’s trump card, making it enjoyable to viewers by seamless scene transitions and some elements pop onto the screen. Fading is an effortless and beautiful effect that hep the clips to merge into the color of another clip smoothly. It is a way of telling viewers there is a visual change without explicitly telling them. The fade effect is in two forms fade in and fade out. Moreover, Fade-in appears at the beginning of the video and fade-out at the end of the video.

Do you want to fade in or out your video to black or white? Then, we have got you. Adobe Premiere Pro is one popular video editing software. Fading is every editor’s trump card, making it enjoyable to viewers by seamless scene transitions and some elements pop onto the screen. Fading is an effortless and beautiful effect that hep the clips to merge into the color of another clip smoothly. It is a way of telling viewers there is a visual change without explicitly telling them. The fade effect is in two forms fade in and fade out. Moreover, Fade-in appears at the beginning of the video and fade-out at the end of the video. And in this blog, we will discuss how to fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p>A fade-in refers to the technique that allows video&#x2F;image to emerge from the black, white, or any color background. In contrast, fade-out relates to the methods which will enable videos&#x2F;images to blend naturally into the black, white, or color background.

Premiere Pro offers many transition effects to edit the videos: Audio, Video, and VR.</p><p>Transitions are generally of two types; single-sided or double-sided transitions. Single-sided is when you have only a single clip. This image shows how the transition fades look. The double-sided transition will have a diagonal line, and the single-sided transition will have one-half light and the other half dark.</p><h5 id="Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-2"><a href="#Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-2" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Apply Transition between the clips"></a>Step1 Apply Transition between the clips</h5><p>Initially, you need to apply the transition to add fading effects. First, choose Window &gt; Effects. Expand the video or audio transitions, expand the bin containing the transition, and drag and drop the required transition between the two clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/apply-transition.jpg"                      alt="apply transition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136616/26400" target="_top" id="2136616">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136616" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136616/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions-2"><a href="#Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions-2" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Single-Sided Transitions"></a>Step2 Single-Sided Transitions</h5><p>When you place the transition on a single cut, click on Ctrl + drag on the transition to the timeline.

A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg"                      alt="types of crossfade"                ></p><p>You can find these options in Effects &gt; Audio Transitions &gt; Crossfade available in the project panel.

But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power-2"><a href="#Constant-Power-2" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade-2"><a href="#Exponential-Fade-2" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve.

It is a way of telling viewers there is a visual change without explicitly telling them. The fade effect is in two forms fade in and fade out. Moreover, Fade-in appears at the beginning of the video and fade-out at the end of the video. And in this blog, we will discuss how to fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p>A fade-in refers to the technique that allows video&#x2F;image to emerge from the black, white, or any color background. In contrast, fade-out relates to the methods which will enable videos&#x2F;images to blend naturally into the black, white, or color background. We will also learn how to fade in video Premiere Pro.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Add Video fade in Premiere Pro](#Part 3)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro</h2><p>Premiere Pro to add fade transition can be between clips to link and move from one shot to another shot smoothly. Premiere Pro offers many transition effects to edit the videos: Audio, Video, and VR.</p><p>Transitions are generally of two types; single-sided or double-sided transitions. Single-sided is when you have only a single clip. This image shows how the transition fades look. The double-sided transition will have a diagonal line, and the single-sided transition will have one-half light and the other half dark.</p><h5 id="Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-3"><a href="#Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-3" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Apply Transition between the clips"></a>Step1 Apply Transition between the clips</h5><p>Initially, you need to apply the transition to add fading effects. First, choose Window &gt; Effects. Expand the video or audio transitions, expand the bin containing the transition, and drag and drop the required transition between the two clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/apply-transition.jpg"                      alt="apply transition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137378/7443" target="_top" id="2137378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137378/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions-3"><a href="#Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions-3" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Single-Sided Transitions"></a>Step2 Single-Sided Transitions</h5><p>When you place the transition on a single cut, click on Ctrl + drag on the transition to the timeline. Release the mouse when the “End at Cut” or “Start at Cut” icon appears.</p><p>End At Cut: Adjust the end transition at the end of the first clip</p><p>Start At Cut: Adjust the start of the transition at the beginning of the first clip. This is another method to add fade in the Premiere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/start-and-end.jpg"                      alt="start and end"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Fade-In-Out-sound-on-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Part-2-Fade-In-Out-sound-on-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro"></a>Part 2 Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro</h2><p>Are you in doubt about how to fade background music in Premiere Pro? A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg"                      alt="types of crossfade"                ></p><p>You can find these options in Effects &gt; Audio Transitions &gt; Crossfade available in the project panel. This is how to add a crossfade in Premiere with just three simple steps. There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain-3"><a href="#Constant-Gain-3" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power-3"><a href="#Constant-Power-3" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade-3"><a href="#Exponential-Fade-3" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/exponential-fade.jpg"                      alt="exponential fade"                ></p><p>Thus, now you know how to add crossfade in Premiere Pro smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro</h2><p>When we want to add a black color between two videos for smooth movements, the best idea is to fade-in and fade-out. In Premiere Pro, you will not find a fade option directly. It will appear as Film Dissolve in the settings of the Premiere Pro dashboard. Below is an example clip of how the video will look if you add black color fading effects. Let us discuss how to add video fade in Premiere Pro.</p><h5 id="Step-1-Choose-the-effect-3"><a href="#Step-1-Choose-the-effect-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Choose the effect"></a>Step 1 Choose the effect</h5><p>To add fade in Premiere Pro, navigate Effects &gt; Video Transitions &gt; Dissolve &gt; Film Dissolve.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/film-dissolve.jpg"                      alt="film dissolve"                ></p><p>Fade in and out can be done using Film Dissolve found in the Video transitions folder.</p><h5 id="Step-2-Appling-Fade-in-out-3"><a href="#Step-2-Appling-Fade-in-out-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Appling Fade in&#x2F;out"></a>Step 2 Appling Fade in&#x2F;out</h5><p>In Adobe Premiere, add Fade in or out, click and hold on Film Dissolve effect. Drag the Effect onto the video portion in the Timeline to create a fade-in effect drop at the beginning of the clip. To create a fade-out effect, drop at the end of the clip. After everything is automatic, you can clip on the Play button to see its action.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/applying-film-dissolve.jpg"                      alt="applying film dissolve"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-Change-length-of-the-Fade-in-and-out-effects-3"><a href="#Step-3-Change-length-of-the-Fade-in-and-out-effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 Change length of the Fade in and out effects"></a>Step 3 Change length of the Fade in and out effects</h5><p>It is possible to change the length of the Fade in and out effects after the film dissolve is applied. You can notice that the Fade gets added between the clip. Inside the video, there is a small box. You can click on it drag their edges to increase the duration of the fade-in&#x2F;out in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/change-length.jpg"                      alt="change length"                ></p><p>Short video transitions are the best between the clips for most transitions. No one would like to wait between two scenes, but there are situations you might want to extend. This is how to add fade in the premiere.</p><h3 id="Tip-Fade-In-Out-Effects-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Tip-Fade-In-Out-Effects-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Tip: Fade In&#x2F;Out Effects with Filmora"></a>Tip: Fade In&#x2F;Out Effects with Filmora</h3><p>There is many other professional editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro for Fade in&#x2F;out, but Wondershare Filmora offers the easiest and simple way.

These days, most computers have built-in webcams, so one of the easiest ways to start recording video is to use a webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-webcam-for-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast camera"                ></p><p>Webcams are inexpensive, easy to set up, and usually already come pre-loaded with software that will allow you to record video and audio for your podcast.</p><h2 id="What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting"><a href="#What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting" class="headerlink" title="What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?"></a>What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?</h2><p>Adding video to your podcasts can help them stand out. However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there’s no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:</p><h3 id="1-Field-of-view"><a href="#1-Field-of-view" class="headerlink" title="(1) Field of view"></a>(1) Field of view</h3><p>It’s essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.</p><h3 id="2-Picture-quality"><a href="#2-Picture-quality" class="headerlink" title="(2) Picture quality"></a>(2) Picture quality</h3><p>The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.</p><h3 id="3-Companion-software"><a href="#3-Companion-software" class="headerlink" title="(3) Companion software"></a>(3) Companion software</h3><p>Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful. The final product will look much better. You can add your music to your videos, text your podcasts and other media, or edit and remix your audio and video recordings using the editing features. And you know what the most exciting part about webcam companion software is? That the downloading is free of cost.</p><h2 id="The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022"><a href="#The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022"></a>The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022</h2><p>Each year, the technology people use to listen to podcasts continues to improve.

However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there’s no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:</p><h3 id="1-Field-of-view-1"><a href="#1-Field-of-view-1" class="headerlink" title="(1) Field of view"></a>(1) Field of view</h3><p>It’s essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.</p><h3 id="2-Picture-quality-1"><a href="#2-Picture-quality-1" class="headerlink" title="(2) Picture quality"></a>(2) Picture quality</h3><p>The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.</p><h3 id="3-Companion-software-1"><a href="#3-Companion-software-1" class="headerlink" title="(3) Companion software"></a>(3) Companion software</h3><p>Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful. The final product will look much better. You can add your music to your videos, text your podcasts and other media, or edit and remix your audio and video recordings using the editing features. And you know what the most exciting part about webcam companion software is? That the downloading is free of cost.</p><h2 id="The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022-1"><a href="#The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022-1" class="headerlink" title="The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022"></a>The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022</h2><p>Each year, the technology people use to listen to podcasts continues to improve.

Also, cross-check the <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong> resolution before posting it and make sure it’s 1080 x1920.</p><p>However, if the video’s resolution exceeds 1080p, don’t panic because TikTok will automatically minimize it. Other than this, keep the video at 9:16 for a better watching experience. As for the file size, it can vary with your device. For Android, it’s 72MB, and for Apple, it’s 287.6MB. The file types for unboxing videos TikTok support are MOV and MP4.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="create proper size tiktok videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014853/22899" target="_top" id="2014853">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014853" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014853/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition"><a href="#Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition"></a>Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition</h3><p>It is evident that if your TikTok has no captivating and significant points, no one will watch it.

Smartphones are incredibly versatile and</p><p>widely used. Where does that leave the desktop PC, a relic of the 1980s? There are still a ton of options</p><p>available, and the desktop market is constantly innovating, particularly regarding all-in-one and small-</p><p>form-factor devices. But many customers appear to view desktop computers as an antique, since they</p><p>immediately walk to the laptop aisle when making their next computer purchase.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Corsair One i300</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Lenovo Yoga A940</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Azulle Access4</a></li><li><a href="#part2-6">Alienware Aurora R13</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How much CPU power do you need</a></li><li><a href="#part4">What graphics card do you need</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost"><a href="#Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?"></a>Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?</h2><p>The value the desktop offers are among its most attractive claims. With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135372/19272" target="_top" id="2135372">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135372" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135372/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What desktops are recommended?"></a>Part 2. What desktops are recommended?</h2><p>Choosing a new PC tower might be challenging, but we’ve outlined the top models for each function, from</p><p>gaming powerhouses to small PCs for your home office. You may use this list to locate the finest PC to meet</p><p>your demands, whether you’re a student, a busy professional, or an avid gamer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037475/7443" target="_top" id="2037475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5"><a href="#1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5" class="headerlink" title="1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5"></a>1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</h3><p>Even so, there are times when you just want the best of the best, the absolute cream of the crop. It won’t be</p><p>for everyone, of course. That, in our opinion, is the MSI MEG Aegis Ti5: a jaw-droppingly distinctive gaming PC with an almost absurdly powerful hardware setup. The front of the computer features a “Gamer Dial” that can be used to adjust system performance settings and display data or amusing animations on a tiny circular</p><p>display.</p><p>The MEG Aegis Ti5 is available in several versions, all of which have the newest gaming hardware. The</p><p>most recent top-spec setup uses an Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics card and an ultra-modern Intel Core i9-12900K</p><p>CPU, but there are many other variants available if that isn’t precisely what you’re looking for. Of course, the</p><p>majority of these models will set you back a good coin, but if performance is what you’re after, look no further.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948876/19272" target="_top" id="1948876">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948876" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948876/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Corsair-One-i300"><a href="#2-Corsair-One-i300" class="headerlink" title="2. Corsair One i300"></a>2. Corsair One i300</h3><p>The Corsair One i300 is a brilliantly little workstation computer with top-tier performance in a footprint that is barely any larger than the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i, which is found higher on this list. It is a genuinely</p><p>innovative bit of computer hardware architecture. Due to its single fan positioned on the roof and perforated</p><p>side panels, it also operates more quietly than many powerful PCs.</p><p>Given its high-end internal components and expensive starting price, the One i300 is probably a little overkill</p><p>for the ordinary user. However, there is no doubt that this is the most potent small form factor PC currently on the market, and Corsair provides a choice of variants with AMD and Intel processors.</p><p>This is a great option if you’re searching for a high-end PC for resource-intensive content creation jobs or 4K</p><p>gaming (or both!). Fortunately, the hardware on offer here means that the Corsair One i300 should serve you</p><p>for years to come even though the extremely compact design makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pry open</p><p>the chassis to replace your components.</p><h3 id="3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020"><a href="#3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020" class="headerlink" title="3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)"></a>3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</h3><p>The arrival of the Apple M1 chip meant new Mac hardware across the board, and naturally this included a</p><p>much-needed update to the smallest Apple computer: the Mac Mini. The 2020 M1 edition of this pint-sized</p><p>(Well, it’s actually smaller than a pint) Mac is more powerful than ever, with the new processor offering solid</p><p>performance in video editing, digital art, and even iOS gaming thanks to the new chip.</p><p>Despite this, it’s still Apple’s cheapest Mac ever, with the base model starting at $700 for 8GB of RAM and a</p><p>256GB drive. Budget-conscious Apple fans looking for the best computer need look no further; this is the</p><p>definitive version of the Mac Mini. It retains the same clean design as its predecessors, with a decent selection</p><p>of ports on the rear edge and a thick rubber base that keeps it from sliding around on your desk. The only</p><p>significant downside of the new model is that it can no longer use external GPUs, which could limit its potential</p><p>for users looking to run demanding graphics-intensive software.</p><h3 id="4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940"><a href="#4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940" class="headerlink" title="4. Lenovo Yoga A940"></a>4. Lenovo Yoga A940</h3><p>For digital artists, the Lenovo Yoga A940 is without a doubt the best desktop computer available. This feature - rich all-in-one PC from Lenovo is the company’s response to the iMac and is guaranteed to pique the interest of creative types. A magnificent 27-inch 4K display with outstanding contrast and color richness, a strong 25- degree rotating hinge, and a smart stylus are all included.</p><p>The included “content creation dial,” a clever addition that offers tactile control to a number of activities, such</p><p>as zooming in and out on a virtual canvas or scrolling across pages, may be plugged in on either side of the</p><p>screen. On the base of the device, there is also an LED light array and a wireless phone charging pad.</p><p>In general, the Yoga A940 outperforms sleek all-in-one laptops like the Apple iMac and Surface Studio 2, both of which choose clean, simple designs over cramming in exciting features like Lenovo has. Naturally, a mouse and keyboard are provided, though you might wish to update as they are a rather common set. The only significant drawback is the Yoga A940’s somewhat outdated internal components, which prevent it from</p><p>handling intensive tasks like 4K video editing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098705/14409" target="_top" id="2098705">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098705" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098705/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Azulle-Access4"><a href="#5-Azulle-Access4" class="headerlink" title="5. Azulle Access4"></a>5. Azulle Access4</h3><p>A stick PC can be the best option if you’re constantly on the road and would prefer not to lug along a heavy</p><p>laptop. These tiny computers, often known as “compute sticks,” are made to be plugged into a screen and used right away, making them ideal for professionals who work quickly. The Azulle Access4 may resemble a large flash drive more than a computer, but it can be hooked into any monitor with an HDMI port to turn it into a fully functional Windows or Linux PC.</p><p>The Access4 is simple to use and well-equipped for fundamental tasks like word processing or maintaining</p><p>spreadsheets thanks to its 4GB of RAM and Intel Celeron processor. Since there are no fans, it won’t even emit a whisper of noise and is small enough to put in your jacket pocket. For office workers who may have switched to a “hotdesking” environment, Azulle even sells a Zoom-oriented version that can transform any screen and webcam into an instant videoconferencing tool.</p><h3 id="6-Alienware-Aurora-R13"><a href="#6-Alienware-Aurora-R13" class="headerlink" title="6. Alienware Aurora R13"></a>6. Alienware Aurora R13</h3><p>Since so much of Alienware’s business is focused on making you a PC with the particular components you</p><p>desire, a judgment of the Aurora R13 is largely a judgment of the new Legend 2.0 chassis. And we can confirm</p><p>that the Aurora R13’s new appearance is a hit after working, playing, and tinkering with our review device for a few weeks.</p><p>Even after playing in 4K for hours, the redesigned chassis is simple to access, has lots of ports, and has enough</p><p>ventilation that I didn’t detect much more than a gentle hum and a pleasant warmth coming from the PC. The computer is a bit heavy to move about (mind those fins) or set down on a desk because it can weigh up to 35 pounds. However, if your desk has room for it, the futuristic style and programmable RGB lighting are sure to draw attention.</p><p>If you can afford it, Alienware will outfit the Aurora R13 with premium parts to turn it into a top-notch gaming</p><p>computer. Our review device is not cheap, costing close to $3,000, but it has the capacity to play today’s top</p><p>games in 1080p for years to come. Just be aware that you shouldn’t anticipate getting 4K framerates that are</p><p>lightning quick for that price; the Aurora R13 becomes just as pricey as the other PCs on our list when outfitted</p><p>with premium components.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?"></a>Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?</h2><p>A desktop tower’s utilization of a desktop-grade CPU is one of its key advantages. It may seem simple, but that is a crucial distinction.</p><p>The two largest PC processor manufacturers, AMD and Intel, provide desktop-class chips and laptop-class chips to system builders, although frequently the CPU model names are identical and difficult to distinguish. For instance, you can find Intel’s Core i7 in both laptops and desktops, but a “real” desktop CPU as opposed to one designed for a mobile device performs far better.</p><p>For challenging content creation tasks, PC gaming, or math and science projects, a desktop CPU gives you</p><p>additional power. Software developed to take advantage of the extra cores will profit from faster processors</p><p>with four, six, eight, or perhaps as many as 18 cores. In comparison to variants created for laptops, which must</p><p>be integrated into surroundings with less thermal and power-delivery leeway, the desktop version of a given</p><p>CPU will use more energy and produce more heat. The ability to multithread, which enables each of the CPU’s</p><p>cores to address two processing threads simultaneously rather of just one, is another important feature that</p><p>can be more easily included into a desktop CPU. When used with appropriate software, multithreading,</p><p>sometimes known as “Hyper-Threading” by Intel, can significantly improve performance.</p><p>High-end towers with enough of interior room are the only ones that can accommodate liquid cooling systems, which are only necessary for the very highest-end desktop CPUs. These are very specialized and expensive processors, so you should only use them if you have extremely particular software requirements that you are certain can take use of their higher base and peak clock rates as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not only random purchases.</p><p>Contrarily, many AIOs and tiny PCs employ the same effective, cooler-running CPU designs as you may find in laptops. While most desktop chips have a “T” or “K” or simply a zero at the end, Intel often marks their mobile- first chip designs with a CPU name that contains “U,” “H,” or “P.” Despite having the same number of</p><p>processing cores as its desktop equivalent (four- and six-core CPUs are also frequently found in both), a mobile CPU’s maximum power consumption is frequently much lower. The average base and boost clock rates might also be slower, and the processor might not enable multithreading. However, a lot of desktop PC customers will be able to do their daily tasks and a little more with these lower-powered CPUs.</p><p>Common users should look for an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 for a typical tower with a true desktop-grade</p><p>CPU; the Core i7 and Ryzen 7 are also excellent, powerful options, but overkill for most people who aren’t</p><p>serious PC gamers, intensive multitaskers, prosumer or pro video or image manipulators. However, if CPU</p><p>power is a top priority, these should be adequate.</p><p>Only if you are aware that your workflow is being slowed down by insufficient cores or threads or if you have</p><p>extremely high internal storage requirements are the Core i9, Ryzen 9, Ryzen Threadripper, and Core X-Series</p><p>worth the money (for which the Threadripper and Core X can help with internal resources).</p><h2 id="Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. What graphics card do you need?"></a>Part 4. What graphics card do you need?</h2><p>If you want to construct your own PC or purchase the greatest gaming PC, investing in the best graphics card is essential. More crucial than the CPU is the graphics card. Unfortunately, figuring out how to purchase a GPU might be challenging. There are other factors to consider, including the type of monitor you’re using (for</p><p>suggestions, check our Best Gaming Monitors page, which opens in a new browser), the size of your PC case,</p><p>and the game settings you want to use.</p><p>The considerations you should make while choosing your next GPU are listed below. To evaluate how today’s</p><p>GPUs stack up against earlier cards that you might be wanting to replace or upgrade, check out our list of the</p><p>best graphics cards available right now. You can also view the GPU Benchmarks Hierarchy.</p><p>Thankfully, the supply and GPU costs for AMD’s RX 6000 cards and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series cards both continue</p><p>to rise.

How much does a desktop cost?"></a>Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?</h2><p>The value the desktop offers are among its most attractive claims. With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

That, in our opinion, is the MSI MEG Aegis Ti5: a jaw-droppingly distinctive gaming PC with an almost absurdly powerful hardware setup. The front of the computer features a “Gamer Dial” that can be used to adjust system performance settings and display data or amusing animations on a tiny circular</p><p>display.</p><p>The MEG Aegis Ti5 is available in several versions, all of which have the newest gaming hardware. The</p><p>most recent top-spec setup uses an Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics card and an ultra-modern Intel Core i9-12900K</p><p>CPU, but there are many other variants available if that isn’t precisely what you’re looking for.

Corsair One i300</h3><p>The Corsair One i300 is a brilliantly little workstation computer with top-tier performance in a footprint that is barely any larger than the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i, which is found higher on this list. It is a genuinely</p><p>innovative bit of computer hardware architecture. Due to its single fan positioned on the roof and perforated</p><p>side panels, it also operates more quietly than many powerful PCs.</p><p>Given its high-end internal components and expensive starting price, the One i300 is probably a little overkill</p><p>for the ordinary user. However, there is no doubt that this is the most potent small form factor PC currently on the market, and Corsair provides a choice of variants with AMD and Intel processors.</p><p>This is a great option if you’re searching for a high-end PC for resource-intensive content creation jobs or 4K</p><p>gaming (or both!). Fortunately, the hardware on offer here means that the Corsair One i300 should serve you</p><p>for years to come even though the extremely compact design makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pry open</p><p>the chassis to replace your components.</p><h3 id="3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020-1"><a href="#3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</h3><p>The arrival of the Apple M1 chip meant new Mac hardware across the board, and naturally this included a</p><p>much-needed update to the smallest Apple computer: the Mac Mini. The 2020 M1 edition of this pint-sized</p><p>(Well, it’s actually smaller than a pint) Mac is more powerful than ever, with the new processor offering solid</p><p>performance in video editing, digital art, and even iOS gaming thanks to the new chip.</p><p>Despite this, it’s still Apple’s cheapest Mac ever, with the base model starting at $700 for 8GB of RAM and a</p><p>256GB drive. Budget-conscious Apple fans looking for the best computer need look no further; this is the</p><p>definitive version of the Mac Mini. It retains the same clean design as its predecessors, with a decent selection</p><p>of ports on the rear edge and a thick rubber base that keeps it from sliding around on your desk. The only</p><p>significant downside of the new model is that it can no longer use external GPUs, which could limit its potential</p><p>for users looking to run demanding graphics-intensive software.</p><h3 id="4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940-1"><a href="#4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Lenovo Yoga A940"></a>4. Lenovo Yoga A940</h3><p>For digital artists, the Lenovo Yoga A940 is without a doubt the best desktop computer available. This feature - rich all-in-one PC from Lenovo is the company’s response to the iMac and is guaranteed to pique the interest of creative types. A magnificent 27-inch 4K display with outstanding contrast and color richness, a strong 25- degree rotating hinge, and a smart stylus are all included.</p><p>The included “content creation dial,” a clever addition that offers tactile control to a number of activities, such</p><p>as zooming in and out on a virtual canvas or scrolling across pages, may be plugged in on either side of the</p><p>screen. On the base of the device, there is also an LED light array and a wireless phone charging pad.</p><p>In general, the Yoga A940 outperforms sleek all-in-one laptops like the Apple iMac and Surface Studio 2, both of which choose clean, simple designs over cramming in exciting features like Lenovo has. Naturally, a mouse and keyboard are provided, though you might wish to update as they are a rather common set. The only significant drawback is the Yoga A940’s somewhat outdated internal components, which prevent it from</p><p>handling intensive tasks like 4K video editing.</p><h3 id="5-Azulle-Access4-1"><a href="#5-Azulle-Access4-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Azulle Access4"></a>5. Azulle Access4</h3><p>A stick PC can be the best option if you’re constantly on the road and would prefer not to lug along a heavy</p><p>laptop. These tiny computers, often known as “compute sticks,” are made to be plugged into a screen and used right away, making them ideal for professionals who work quickly. The Azulle Access4 may resemble a large flash drive more than a computer, but it can be hooked into any monitor with an HDMI port to turn it into a fully functional Windows or Linux PC.</p><p>The Access4 is simple to use and well-equipped for fundamental tasks like word processing or maintaining</p><p>spreadsheets thanks to its 4GB of RAM and Intel Celeron processor. Since there are no fans, it won’t even emit a whisper of noise and is small enough to put in your jacket pocket. For office workers who may have switched to a “hotdesking” environment, Azulle even sells a Zoom-oriented version that can transform any screen and webcam into an instant videoconferencing tool.</p><h3 id="6-Alienware-Aurora-R13-1"><a href="#6-Alienware-Aurora-R13-1" class="headerlink" title="6.

Alienware Aurora R13</h3><p>Since so much of Alienware’s business is focused on making you a PC with the particular components you</p><p>desire, a judgment of the Aurora R13 is largely a judgment of the new Legend 2.0 chassis. And we can confirm</p><p>that the Aurora R13’s new appearance is a hit after working, playing, and tinkering with our review device for a few weeks.</p><p>Even after playing in 4K for hours, the redesigned chassis is simple to access, has lots of ports, and has enough</p><p>ventilation that I didn’t detect much more than a gentle hum and a pleasant warmth coming from the PC. The computer is a bit heavy to move about (mind those fins) or set down on a desk because it can weigh up to 35 pounds. However, if your desk has room for it, the futuristic style and programmable RGB lighting are sure to draw attention.</p><p>If you can afford it, Alienware will outfit the Aurora R13 with premium parts to turn it into a top-notch gaming</p><p>computer. Our review device is not cheap, costing close to $3,000, but it has the capacity to play today’s top</p><p>games in 1080p for years to come. Just be aware that you shouldn’t anticipate getting 4K framerates that are</p><p>lightning quick for that price; the Aurora R13 becomes just as pricey as the other PCs on our list when outfitted</p><p>with premium components.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304647">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304647%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304647/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?"></a>Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?</h2><p>A desktop tower’s utilization of a desktop-grade CPU is one of its key advantages. It may seem simple, but that is a crucial distinction.</p><p>The two largest PC processor manufacturers, AMD and Intel, provide desktop-class chips and laptop-class chips to system builders, although frequently the CPU model names are identical and difficult to distinguish. For instance, you can find Intel’s Core i7 in both laptops and desktops, but a “real” desktop CPU as opposed to one designed for a mobile device performs far better.</p><p>For challenging content creation tasks, PC gaming, or math and science projects, a desktop CPU gives you</p><p>additional power. Software developed to take advantage of the extra cores will profit from faster processors</p><p>with four, six, eight, or perhaps as many as 18 cores. In comparison to variants created for laptops, which must</p><p>be integrated into surroundings with less thermal and power-delivery leeway, the desktop version of a given</p><p>CPU will use more energy and produce more heat. The ability to multithread, which enables each of the CPU’s</p><p>cores to address two processing threads simultaneously rather of just one, is another important feature that</p><p>can be more easily included into a desktop CPU. When used with appropriate software, multithreading,</p><p>sometimes known as “Hyper-Threading” by Intel, can significantly improve performance.</p><p>High-end towers with enough of interior room are the only ones that can accommodate liquid cooling systems, which are only necessary for the very highest-end desktop CPUs. These are very specialized and expensive processors, so you should only use them if you have extremely particular software requirements that you are certain can take use of their higher base and peak clock rates as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not only random purchases.</p><p>Contrarily, many AIOs and tiny PCs employ the same effective, cooler-running CPU designs as you may find in laptops. While most desktop chips have a “T” or “K” or simply a zero at the end, Intel often marks their mobile- first chip designs with a CPU name that contains “U,” “H,” or “P.” Despite having the same number of</p><p>processing cores as its desktop equivalent (four- and six-core CPUs are also frequently found in both), a mobile CPU’s maximum power consumption is frequently much lower. The average base and boost clock rates might also be slower, and the processor might not enable multithreading. However, a lot of desktop PC customers will be able to do their daily tasks and a little more with these lower-powered CPUs.</p><p>Common users should look for an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 for a typical tower with a true desktop-grade</p><p>CPU; the Core i7 and Ryzen 7 are also excellent, powerful options, but overkill for most people who aren’t</p><p>serious PC gamers, intensive multitaskers, prosumer or pro video or image manipulators. However, if CPU</p><p>power is a top priority, these should be adequate.</p><p>Only if you are aware that your workflow is being slowed down by insufficient cores or threads or if you have</p><p>extremely high internal storage requirements are the Core i9, Ryzen 9, Ryzen Threadripper, and Core X-Series</p><p>worth the money (for which the Threadripper and Core X can help with internal resources).</p><h2 id="Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need-1"><a href="#Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The ideal computer brand for you will ultimately rely on what you want your PC to be able to do as many computer brands offer the highest quality, most reasonably priced PCs.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-all-encompassing-guide-to-dji-phantom-4s-capabilities/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The All-Encompassing Guide to DJI Phantom 4'S Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-free-easy-to-use-online-editors-for-quick-postings-for-2024/"><u>[New] Free, Easy-to-Use Online Editors for Quick Postings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-correcting-muted-voice-in-obs-broadcasts/"><u>[New] In 2024, Correcting Muted Voice in OBS Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-songsync-guide-tamil-ringtones-from-download-to-customize/"><u>[New] In 2024, SongSync Guide Tamil Ringtones From Download to Customize</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-inshot-cut-mastery-creating-fluid-movements/"><u>[New] Inshot Cut Mastery Creating Fluid Movements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-quickening-your-live-feed-on-periscope-platform/"><u>[New] Quickening Your Live Feed on Periscope Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-unleash-camera-potential-with-10-premium-freebies-and-personalized-purchase-choices/"><u>[New] Unleash Camera Potential with 10 Premium Freebies & Personalized Purchase Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-bringing-images-to-life-expert-level-photo-text-editing/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Bringing Images to Life Expert-Level Photo Text Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unmatched-clarity-best-blu-ray-players-of-24/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unmatched Clarity Best Blu-Ray Players of '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-optimize-your-watch-activate-av1-on-youtube-platform/"><u>[Updated] Optimize Your Watch Activate AV1 on YouTube Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/discover-the-best-free-movie-torrent-sites-top-11-list/"><u>Discover the Best Free Movie Torrent Sites (Top 11 List)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-peasy-memes-step-by-step-in-kinemaster/"><u>In 2024, Easy-Peasy Memes Step by Step in KineMaster</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-smiles-to-text-where-to-find-amusing-tones/"><u>In 2024, Smiles to Text Where to Find Amusing Tones?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/laptop-to-tv-mending-disconnected-hdmi-cable/"><u>Laptop to TV: Mending Disconnected HDMI Cable</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/-making-masters-youtubes-financial-kings/"><u>Money-Making Masters YouTube's Financial Kings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/proven-ways-to-fix-there-was-a-problem-parsing-the-package-on-vivo-v30-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Proven Ways to Fix There Was A Problem Parsing the Package on Vivo V30 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/relapse-prevention-for-2024/"><u>Relapse Prevention for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/t5-unboxed-the-revolution-in-action-filming/"><u>T5 Unboxed - The Revolution in Action Filming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/user-guide-to-the-latest-snappy-driver-installer-v113-performance-review/"><u>User Guide to the Latest Snappy Driver Installer (v1.13) Performance Review</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Now, both on your phone and computer, you can effortlessly book, join, manage, and personalize Zoom in Gmail straight from Gmail and Google Calendar. An add-on for Gmail and Calendar has been released as a result of a collaboration between Zoom and Google. Users of Google Calendar have the option of utilizing Google Meet, the company’s own online meeting tool. Although many people prefer Zoom, that is excellent. For Google Calendar and Zoom to work together effectively, all you need to do is download and install a free app. Here, we’ll go through how to plan meetings using Gmail and Calendar with the Zoom add-on.</p><p>Having a built-in option for scheduling Zoom in Gmail meetings is crucial for individuals who often conduct business through video-based meetings. There are a few methods to link Zoom with Google Calendar if you use both services. With only one click thanks to this connection, you can include a Zoom meeting in a calendar invitation. The default choice for meetings is Google’s video conferencing service, Google Meet. This does not preclude you from using Zoom. To make it similarly frictionless, all you have to do is install a free app. By installing an add-on from the Google Workspace Marketplace, you may quickly do this operation if you use Zoom as your video-conference platform and utilize Google Calendar. When your Zoom meeting times are shown in the Google Calendar app, it is quite convenient. After that, you may get reminders and invite others. How to incorporate Zoom in Gmail is covered in this article. This is how you integrate Zoom with Google Calendar.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Calendar Link Addition</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Make a Video Recording of the Call</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Create Meeting Template</a></li></ol><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Install-Zoom-Add-On-for-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-1-Install-Zoom-Add-On-for-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Install Zoom Add-On for Google Account"></a>Part 1. Install Zoom Add-On for Google Account</h2><p>Using the “Zoom for Gmail” add-on, which connects your Gmail account with Zoom, you may activate Zoom meetings on Gmail. The default choice for meetings is Google’s video conferencing service, Google Meet. To make it similarly frictionless, all you have to do is install a free app. When you include a Zoom meeting in your calendar invitation, all participants may join the meeting by simply clicking the meeting’s details and then clicking again. With this add-on, you may use Gmail’s web client’s collaboration capabilities to initiate and plan Zoom sessions. Visit the Google Workspace store to add Zoom to your G-suite account. How to install this on your account is provided here. You may achieve this by doing the actions listed below:</p><p><strong>Steps to Install Zoom for Gmail</strong></p><p>The procedures for installing the Zoom for G Suite plugin are as follows:</p><h5 id="Step1Visit-the-Google-Workplace-Marketplace"><a href="#Step1Visit-the-Google-Workplace-Marketplace" class="headerlink" title="Step1Visit the Google Workplace Marketplace"></a>Step1Visit the Google Workplace Marketplace</h5><p>Install the Zoom for Gmail add-on via the G Suite Marketplace as your first step. Click Install, continue, and then Allow to get started (when giving Zoom access to your Google account).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-for-gmail.jpg"                      alt="zoom for gmail"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Press-“Install”"><a href="#Step2Press-“Install”" class="headerlink" title="Step2Press “Install”"></a>Step2Press “Install”</h5><p>There is no need to log into Zoom or look through emails to get access. Both choices may be used for free. You can quickly book, join, and manage Zoom meetings from the mobile or desktop versions of your personal Gmail and Google Calendar by using the Zoom for G-Suite add-on. You’ll get a popup on your screen stating “Zoom for Gmail has been installed” when the installation is complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-zoom-for-gmail.jpg"                      alt="install zoom for gmail"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Log-into-your-own-Google-Account"><a href="#Step3Log-into-your-own-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Step3Log into your own Google Account"></a>Step3Log into your own Google Account</h5><p>Launch your web browser and open Gmail. A new Zoom icon with the text “Zoom for Gmail was installed” will appear on the right sidebar. Log into your Zoom account when the new tab has opened, then select Authorize to provide Gmail access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-account-to-continue-zoom.jpg"                      alt="choose account to continue zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Press-“Allow”"><a href="#Step4Press-“Allow”" class="headerlink" title="Step4Press “Allow”"></a>Step4Press “Allow”</h5><p>You will need your account administrator’s prior consent if your Gmail account is a part of a G-suite account. You may provide Gmail access by selecting the “Request pre-approve” button after checking in with your Zoom account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/allow-zoom-meetings-google-account.jpg"                      alt="allow zoom meetings google account"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-start-a-meeting-from-Zoom-for-Gmail"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-start-a-meeting-from-Zoom-for-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to start a meeting from Zoom for Gmail"></a>Part 2. How to start a meeting from Zoom for Gmail</h2><p>G Suite and Zoom may be integrated in both ways. Therefore, each meeting you schedule on Zoom will have an invite link that is instantly posted to your Google Calendar. Install it after logging out of all other Google accounts and signing into the one you wish to add it to. Another feature of the Zoom for Gmail add-on is the ability to book a Zoom conference directly from Gmail. The meeting subject will automatically be pulled from the email subject line into the Google Calendar event. Simply login into Gmail in your browser and start a new email message to begin organizing Zoom meetings. Here’s how to set up a Zoom meeting on your Google Calendar and invite participants:</p><p><strong>Steps to Use Zoom for Gmail</strong></p><p>Step1 Install the “Zoom for G-Suite” plugin, that is free, from the official G-Suite store after logging into your Google account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-zoom-for-gsuite.jpg"                      alt="install zoom for gsuite"                ></p><p>To get install rights if you are using an enterprise account, get in touch with your IT administrator. A lot of rights, including complete access to your whole contact list, are also required by the add-on. Skip this technique and look at Method 2, which does not need the add-on, if that makes you uncomfortable.</p><p>Step2 Now open Google Calendar, and on the right side of the window, locate the Zoom symbol. To log into your Zoom account using the add-on, click the icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="zoom in google calendar"                ></p><p>Step3 Turn on “Pre-approve” and adhere to the on-screen instructions to provide the app access to your Google account information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-pre-approve.jpg"                      alt="enable pre approve"                ></p><p>Step4 Next, check for the “Add Conferencing” box when creating a new Google Calendar event. Then, pick “Zoom Meeting” from the list of possibilities by clicking on the drop-down menu. At the bottom, click “Preserve” to save your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-conference-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="add conference google calendar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step5 The Meeting ID, password, and passcode will now be automatically filled in by the add-on in the Calendar event. Additionally, it will provide a link with joining instructions, which should be helpful for anyone who are unfamiliar with Zoom. You may now invite people to the meeting by clicking on the freshly created event in Google Calendar and using the “Add Guests” section. Finally, choose the “envelope” symbol to send guests an email invitation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-guests-zoom-meeting.jpg"                      alt="add guests zoom meeting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Use-Zoom-for-Gmail"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Use-Zoom-for-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tips to Use Zoom for Gmail"></a>Part 3. Tips to Use Zoom for Gmail</h2><p>Two of the most popular productivity tools are Zoom and G Suite, which are utilized by both businesses and individuals. Users can simply book Zoom meetings from inside Google Calendar and invite friends, family, and coworkers to participate thanks to the connectivity between the two.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528681/16446" target="_top" id="1528681">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528681" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528681/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Calendar-Link-Addition"><a href="#Calendar-Link-Addition" class="headerlink" title="Calendar Link Addition"></a>Calendar Link Addition</h3><p>Without the add-on, you may still include a link to a Zoom meeting in a Google Calendar event. Because the add-on requests a ton of permissions, including full access to your complete contact list, it is really the most private alternative. Keep in mind, too, that using the manual way will not sync your meetings between Zoom and Calendar for you. If you’re okay with that, the following instructions will show you how to add a Zoom invite link to Google Calendar without the add-on:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/calendar-link-addition-meeting.jpg"                      alt="calendar link addition meeting"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576474/17382" target="_top" id="1576474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576474/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Create a new meeting by using the Zoom client on your PC (or Android or iOS phone). Then, on the Meetings page, select the “Copy Invitation” option.</li><li>Open a web browser and log in to Google. After that, enter Google Calendar and manually paste the meeting details into the “Notes” area at the bottom before adding the Zoom invite link. Finally, choose “Save.” As previously mentioned, you may now use the email link to add guests and send invitations.</li><li>After accepting the invitation, the participants will see the meeting link in their Google Calendar and be able to join by clicking the link or the “Join Zoom Meeting” option.</li></ul><h3 id="Make-a-Video-Recording-of-the-Call"><a href="#Make-a-Video-Recording-of-the-Call" class="headerlink" title="Make a Video Recording of the Call"></a>Make a Video Recording of the Call</h3><p>Zoom’s web conferencing call recording as video capability is useful for sharing the conference with individuals who may have missed it or for evaluating the conversation. You must choose either the local or cloud option while recording. Local refers to storing the video file on your own devices, such as your computer or an external storage device.</p><p>Use the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> screen recorder for the much simpler experience.

First of all, you may set all the call preferences you’d like once and have them remain in effect each time you meet. Second, because repeating calls utilize the same join URL each time, you never need to provide attendees with a new one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-zoom-meeting-template.jpg"                      alt="create zoo mmeeting template"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151883/7443" target="_top" id="2151883">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151883" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151883/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a nutshell, so that everyone can arrive on time, you would be able to easily choose “Zoom Meeting” inside your Google Calendar event and create a link to join it.

But on the flip side, there are many issues related to the 4Kresolution like slow video upload speed, high storage, incompatibility with the majority of the device, and similar others.</p><p>Thus, considering these in mind, we can say that 1080p is quite a good resolution for your YouTube and other videos, and thus upscaling it to 4K is not a good or a better choice.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a><strong>Final Words</strong></h2><p>So, if you are facing trouble uploading 4K videos on YouTube, downscaling and converting them to 1080p is the best solution without compromising on the file quality.

It’s one of the world’s most extensive podcast streaming services. So how did it get there? And how can you get on the platform yourself?</p><p>This article dives deep into Apple’s podcast strategy. It includes how to submit to Apple Podcasts, why you should and how to improve your chances of getting on the platform.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Prepare-Your-Show-for-Apple-Podcast-Submission"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-Your-Show-for-Apple-Podcast-Submission" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Prepare Your Show for Apple Podcast Submission"></a>Part 1. Prepare Your Show for Apple Podcast Submission</h2><p>Apple Podcasts submission is an excellent opportunity to earn severe exposure to your podcast. It would be best to start by sending your show to Apple for review. Then, we’ll help you with the steps to get your podcast accepted on Apple Podcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Apple Podcasts is not a podcast-hosting site. You’re not uploading your audio files to Apple. Instead, you’re telling Apple where to find your audio files on the web. Apple finds your files via an RSS feed that links to your hosting site.</p><h3 id="Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site"><a href="#Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site" class="headerlink" title="Publish an episode on a hosting site"></a>Publish an episode on a hosting site</h3><p>The first requirement of Apple Podcasts is a published episode. You need to give Apple a list to start. It can be a trailer or your first podcast episode posted on a hosting site. You can use any hosting service to publish your episode. One of the best is <a class="link"   href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/" >buzzsprout <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which offers hosting services, promotion, and marketing opportunities for podcasters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-1.jpg"                      alt="buzzsprout website"                ></p><p>A podcast hosting site stores your podcast files and distributes them to various podcast streaming platforms using an RSS feed. Your hosting site will automatically submit your podcast to podcast streaming platforms. But with the Apple podcast, you will have to submit manually only once.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Submit-Podcasts-to-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Submit-Podcasts-to-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How To Submit Podcasts to Apple Podcasts?</h2><p>If you’re not submitting your podcast to Apple Podcasts, you’re missing out on the opportunity to earn revenue from ads and sponsorships. So we set out to find the easiest way to submit a podcast to Apple Podcasts and make it easy for everyone else.</p><p>After publishing your first episode to a podcast hosting site, there are a few required fields that you can find on settings:</p><ul><li>Podcast description</li><li>Podcast artwork (square)</li><li>Apple Podcasts category</li><li>Language selection</li><li>Explicit checkbox</li></ul><p>It’s time to submit your show to Apple Podcasts.</p><p>Step1 Go to Apple Podcasts directory instructions in Buzzsprout and click ‘Get listed.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-2.jpg"                      alt="click get listed"                ></p><p>Step2 You can see that we have already done steps 1 and 2, according to Apple.
