The following tips will help you take your iPhone photography to a new level.</p><h4 id="1-Become-a-Master-of-Light"><a href="#1-Become-a-Master-of-Light" class="headerlink" title="1.  Become a Master of Light"></a>1.  Become a Master of Light</h4><p> Photography is the art of writing with light, as a matter of fact, the way you use light in a photo will determine how good it is. The trouble is, that each scene you shoot is going to have different light values, which means that you’ll have to adjust the iPhone camera settings each time you decide to take a photo on a new location.</p><p><strong>How to Avoid Sources of Light in a Shot:</strong> The first and most basic rule of photography is to try to avoid having sources of light in your shot, and the best way to achieve this is to turn your back to the light source and have the subject of the photo positioned in the direction from which the light is coming from. If you do this, taking pictures that depict stark contrast of shadows and light will become much easier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-use-shadows-in-photography.jpg"                      alt="take-use-shadows-in-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: Contrastly</p><p><strong>How to Take a Silhouette Photo:</strong> If you want to take a silhouette photo, simply place the subject of a photo between the light source and your iPhone camera. The source of light in the background will direct too much light into your camera, which will force you to reduce the exposure of a photo, thus the subject of the photo will become underexposed or a mere silhouette.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-silhoutte-photo.jpg"                      alt="get-silhoutte-photo"                ></p><p> Image resource: YouTube</p><p><strong>How to Take Advantage of Natural Light:</strong> The best periods during the day for photography are the sunrise and the sunset because the light provided by the sun is the softest. Portrait and numerous other genres of photography benefit from soft, diffused light. The colors in your pictures will appear much warmer and the results you’ll be able to get will be much more visually pleasing than on photos on which you used direct lightning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/golden-hour-photo.jpg"                      alt="golden-hour-photo"                ></p><p> Image resource: Contrastly</p><h4 id="2-Learn-How-To-Compose-Your-Photos-and-Videos"><a href="#2-Learn-How-To-Compose-Your-Photos-and-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.  Learn How To Compose Your Photos and Videos"></a>2.  Learn How To Compose Your Photos and Videos</h4><p> Organization of the elements depicted within a frame is called composition, and each iPhone videographer or photographer has to practice shot composition in order to be able to improve the quality of the visual content they are producing. Some of the most basic principles of picture composition include the rule of thirds or the diagonal method of arranging objects on a photo.</p><p><strong>How to Use the Grid feature:</strong> The Grid feature on iPhone camera app can help you master the rule of thirds because it will divide your screen into nine equal rectangles, so you can use each rectangle to improve the organization of the elements within a shot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/grid-mode-iphone.jpg"                      alt="grid-mode-iphone"                ></p><p> Image resource: Macworld</p><p><strong>How to Use the Diagonal Method of Image Composition:</strong> Using the diagonal method of photo composition is also a fairly simple task, since you just need to follow a diagonal of the frame, and you can use this method on horizontally and vertically oriented images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/diagonal-photography.jpg"                      alt="diagonal-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: PictureCorrect</p><p><strong>How to Use Symetry on a Photo:</strong> Symmetry is often used for the depiction of reflections because this method of photo composition enables you to show the real object or a scene and its reflections in equal measure. Symmetric photos are more pleasing to the human eye than asymmetric images, which is the reason why pictures that use symmetry as the guiding compositional principal have a better chance of being recognized as good or beautiful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/symetry-photography.jpg"                      alt="symetry-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: PictureCorrect</p><h4 id="3-Use-Different-Camera-Angles-to-Depict-a-Scene"><a href="#3-Use-Different-Camera-Angles-to-Depict-a-Scene" class="headerlink" title="3.  Use Different Camera Angles to Depict a Scene"></a>3.  Use Different Camera Angles to Depict a Scene</h4><p><strong>How to Use 180-degree Rule:</strong> When approaching a new scene, even a simple scene such as a selfie, try to visualize a straight line at the height of your eye level between the iPhone camera you are holding and the subject of the photo. The so-called 180-degree rule suggests that you shouldn’t ever cross that imaginary line, but each degree between 0 and 180 degrees can be an angle from which you take the shot.</p><p><strong>How to Use Low-Angle Shots:</strong> Every camera position that goes above this line is called the bird’s eye view, and each camera position below this line is called a low-angle shot. Placing the camera below the level of your eyesight can be quite beneficial for the photo’s aesthetic qualities because it will offer a unique view of the scene to the viewer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/low-angle-shot-photography.jpg"                      alt="low-angle-shot-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: Storyboard Class</p><p> Exploring different camera angles will enable you to show the scene from different points of view and it will allow you to ‘solve’ the scene in a more efficient way. Assuming that the best angle for a certain scene is at our eye level is natural, but trying to depict a scene from different points of view usually results in better pictures.</p><h4 id="4-Accentuate-Depth-in-Your-Images"><a href="#4-Accentuate-Depth-in-Your-Images" class="headerlink" title="4.  Accentuate Depth in Your Images"></a>4.  Accentuate Depth in Your Images</h4><p><strong>How to Separate the Foreground From the Background:</strong> The illusion of depth in a photo makes the picture look more realistic, and it also creates a visual dynamics between the foreground and the background of an image. There are a number of techniques you can use to accentuate depth on your photos or in your videos. The most common trick is to move the subject of your photo into the background and have the elements in the foreground lead the spectator to the subject.</p><p> <strong>How to Use Shallow Depth of Field:</strong> Alternatively, you can place the subject of a photo in the foreground, thus creating a considerable amount of separation between the two picture planes. The blurry background surrounding the razor-sharp foreground creates an illusion of depth that captivates the viewer’s attention. In order to achieve this you need to create a shallow depth of field, which may not be an easy task when using an iPhone camera, fortunately, there are a lot of apps at the App Store that can be used to highlight the illusion of depth in a photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/separate-the-foreground-from-background.jpg"                      alt="separate-the-foreground-from-background"                ></p><p> Image resource: Makeuseof</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-profile-pictures-download-for-free/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Profile Pictures - Download for FREE!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-windows-10-update-spotlight-new-wins-and-more/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Windows 10 Update Spotlight New Wins and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-conquer-broadcasting-unite-obs-and-streamlabs-for-mac/"><u>[New] Conquer Broadcasting Unite OBS & Streamlabs for Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-effective-methods-for-stable-windows-11-photos-viewing/"><u>[New] Effective Methods for Stable Windows 11 Photos Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-screen-capture-mastery-on-iphone-7-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlocking Screen Capture Mastery on iPhone 7 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-adding-images-to-instagram-made-simple/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Adding Images to Instagram Made Simple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-from-snapchat-to-youtube-uploading-pics-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Snapchat to YouTube Uploading Pics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-how-many-videos-fit-in-64128gb-data-insight-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How Many Videos Fit In 64/128GB?

The mobile version was nominated for the Best Mobile Game at The Game Awards in 2018. PUBG is also popular among youths because it allows them to interact with audience members before action.</p><p>Additionally, many youths love PUBG because it has engaging gameplay that forces them to think and act fast. Every decision the player makes has a massive impact on the game’s outcome and their chances of survival.</p><p>Players have to set priorities and scavenge for resources.

With this, people can communicate with each other and share thoughts by commenting and reacting to someone’s content or posts. In this composition, you will learn how to see YouTube liked comments. But first, let us define what YouTube is.</p><p>People can watch, like, share, comment on, and upload videos using the YouTube service.

Every minute, YouTube receives more than 100 hours of video. Whether you’re disseminating information to students or marketing activities, it’s among the most significant ways to reach a large audience. Some of the benefits of YouTube are listed below.</p><p><strong>Your SEO may use some improvement</strong></p><p>One of the most widely used content types is video, frequently shared on social media. Sharing videos on YouTube with quality titles, descriptions, and tags is a terrific strategy to raise your search engine rating because Google and other search engines favor video content.</p><p><strong>Strong Branding</strong></p><p>Your brand messaging can be quickly and effectively communicated through video. Video is a beautiful medium for expressing the feeling and physical characteristics of your marketing because people respond positively to visual cues.</p><p><strong>Don’t Tell, Show</strong></p><p>Concepts that are difficult to express in word form can be effectively demonstrated through video: use screen capture recordings, live demonstrations, or even whiteboard drawings to present to your pupils.</p><p><strong>Reach a Greater Audience with Your Message</strong></p><p>YouTube is the world’s most widely used video site, and its videos are very shareable. Think about how frequently videos appear on your Twitter feed or Facebook Timeline. How often do you get emails with videos? Video may be easily and quickly shared widely.</p><p><strong>You don’t require a huge budget</strong></p><p>While hiring pros to make various sorts of videos has significant advantages, not all videos require a six-figure budget. With only a few pieces of essential video equipment, you may quickly and easily produce influential movies of lectures, demonstrations, and more.</p><p><strong>Mobile-Friendly Video</strong></p><p>Given how many students have smartphones, video is an excellent medium for connecting with them.

Many young people use YouTube to watch comedy shows, how-to videos, recipes, hacks, and music videos. Teenagers also use the video-sharing platform to subscribe to other YouTubers and famous personalities and to follow their favorite vloggers (video bloggers).</p><p>If you create your own personal YouTube channel and upload your videos, people can like, share, and comment on your videos. You can also comment and like others’ comments on your video. Unfortunately, you can’t see who’s liked or disliked your comments on YouTube, but you can see reactions to your posts.</p><p>If you are still wondering why you can’t see who liked or disliked a Youtube comment, you should know these things:</p><ul><li>Neither you nor anyone else on YouTube can see who liked or disliked your comment.</li><li>YouTube hides users’ likes and dislikes of comments for their protection and security. Still, it’s probably safe to assume that everyone who made a favorable comment on your comment loved it.</li><li>You cannot see who viewed a particular video favorably or unfavorably, but you can see how many individuals did so.</li></ul><p>But, if you want to retrace the videos you commented on and the videos&#x2F;comments you liked or disliked, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Click on your Google Account icon and find <strong>Your data in YouTube</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/find-your-data-in-youtube.jpg"                      alt="find your data in youtube"                ></p><p>Step2 Scroll down a little bit and click the <strong>More</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/your-youtube-dashboard-more.jpg"                      alt="your youtube dashboard more"                ></p><p>Step3 Click the <strong>Comments</strong> section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-comments-your-youtube-dashboard.jpg"                      alt="click comments your youtube dashboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037359/7443" target="_top" id="2037359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037359/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now you will see your comment history, including the date when you commented on a certain video and also the exact comment you posted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/your-youtube-comments-date.jpg"                      alt="your youtube comments date"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902309/19272" target="_top" id="1902309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902309/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>To see videos&#x2F;comments you liked or disliked, please follow these steps as continuation:</p><p>Step4 In the <strong>Google My Activity</strong> tab, click <strong>Other activity</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/other-activity-youtube-comments.jpg"                      alt="other activity youtube comments"                ></p><p>Step5 Scroll down and find <strong>Comment Likes and Dislikes on YouTube</strong> section.

That is why there are just written numbers on the like button and on the dislike button there are none.</p><h2 id="How-to-Respond-to-Comments"><a href="#How-to-Respond-to-Comments" class="headerlink" title="How to Respond to Comments"></a>How to Respond to Comments</h2><p>Don’t ignore someone who has questioned you or written you a heartfelt note. Keep the conversation (and engagement) going by responding to comments.</p><p>Go to your YouTube Studio page and select Comments from the left-hand menu on YouTube. You can check comments you’ve set up to publish automatically without moderation by going to the Published tab.</p><p>They will be lingering on the Held for Review tab if comments need to be approved. (If you don’t agree or delete them within 60 days, comments will be deleted without your intervention.)</p><p>If you’re dealing with a chatty audience, the filter bar at the top of any tab’s tab enables you to filter by specific text, comments with questions, unanswered comments, and more.</p><p>Currently, there is no way to check the liked comments.</p><p>The “like” and “dislike” buttons are both anonymous. This implies that, even if it does, YouTube does not publicly divulge the user’s identity who likes or dislikes a comment, not even the channel owner.</p><p>The concept of neutrality serves as the foundation for anonymous voting. To prevent voting from being analyzed or abused, everyone who loves or dislikes a comment remains anonymous.</p><p>Therefore, you can do the instructions above to see your liked remarks.</p><p>The 1.7 billion monthly unique users of YouTube can express what they love, detest, or must troll in the comments section. It’s like the internet’s very own Thunderdome, yet despite the potential for hate, YouTube comments may also present a significant chance for participation and community development.</p><p>So! Effectively managing your comments (including moderation, answers, and analysis) is essential if you want to maximize your presence on YouTube as part of your social media strategy.</p><p>Engaging with comments has the additional benefit of elevating you in the YouTube algorithm and demonstrating to your fans and followers that you care about what they have to say. Videos that receive a lot of likes, comments, and moderation typically rank higher in search results.</p><p>After all, this composition wants you to know how to see the YouTube liked comments. If you’re going to work in this field, I hope this information helps and motivates you. This article will end by giving you tips and additional information that can help you, especially when pursuing the YouTube industry.</p><p>Remember that you can only leave comments on videos that are public (or unlisted ones). Additionally, once you leave a comment, it becomes public and is linked to your YouTube account. Make sure your message is in the appropriate tone if you’re representing your company, such as this example from a meditation center playing chillhop music.</p><p>Because understanding how to comment is only one aspect of the issue; very important is knowing how to comment well. A brand’s YouTube remark should provide value beyond simply attempting to sell something.</p><p>Try making a joke, pointing out something amusing, providing helpful information, or expressing sympathy or concern for a fan. Additionally, a simple thumbs-up or heart can go a long way to demonstrate that you are paying attention even if you aren’t feeling very friendly (we all have bad days, it’s OK!).</p><h2 id="Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is"><a href="#Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is" class="headerlink" title="Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?"></a>Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?</h2><p>A highlighted comment on YouTube aims to draw the content creator’s attention with an automated feature.</p><p>When you click over to the comments area after receiving a notification about a new comment or a reply to one of your comments, that particular comment will be highlighted for quick access.</p><p>To put it another way, YouTube flags notable comments for you to ensure that new messages or significant replies aren’t lost in the noise. Once you have read or replied to the comment, the highlight will go.</p><p>Additionally, video creators can manually highlight commenters to mark them for later responses. To do this, click on the comment’s timestamp (found next to the commenter’s username).

Keep the conversation (and engagement) going by responding to comments.</p><p>Go to your YouTube Studio page and select Comments from the left-hand menu on YouTube. You can check comments you’ve set up to publish automatically without moderation by going to the Published tab.</p><p>They will be lingering on the Held for Review tab if comments need to be approved. (If you don’t agree or delete them within 60 days, comments will be deleted without your intervention.)</p><p>If you’re dealing with a chatty audience, the filter bar at the top of any tab’s tab enables you to filter by specific text, comments with questions, unanswered comments, and more.</p><p>Currently, there is no way to check the liked comments.</p><p>The “like” and “dislike” buttons are both anonymous. This implies that, even if it does, YouTube does not publicly divulge the user’s identity who likes or dislikes a comment, not even the channel owner.</p><p>The concept of neutrality serves as the foundation for anonymous voting. To prevent voting from being analyzed or abused, everyone who loves or dislikes a comment remains anonymous.</p><p>Therefore, you can do the instructions above to see your liked remarks.</p><p>The 1.7 billion monthly unique users of YouTube can express what they love, detest, or must troll in the comments section. It’s like the internet’s very own Thunderdome, yet despite the potential for hate, YouTube comments may also present a significant chance for participation and community development.</p><p>So! Effectively managing your comments (including moderation, answers, and analysis) is essential if you want to maximize your presence on YouTube as part of your social media strategy.</p><p>Engaging with comments has the additional benefit of elevating you in the YouTube algorithm and demonstrating to your fans and followers that you care about what they have to say. Videos that receive a lot of likes, comments, and moderation typically rank higher in search results.</p><p>After all, this composition wants you to know how to see the YouTube liked comments. If you’re going to work in this field, I hope this information helps and motivates you. This article will end by giving you tips and additional information that can help you, especially when pursuing the YouTube industry.</p><p>Remember that you can only leave comments on videos that are public (or unlisted ones). Additionally, once you leave a comment, it becomes public and is linked to your YouTube account. Make sure your message is in the appropriate tone if you’re representing your company, such as this example from a meditation center playing chillhop music.</p><p>Because understanding how to comment is only one aspect of the issue; very important is knowing how to comment well. A brand’s YouTube remark should provide value beyond simply attempting to sell something.</p><p>Try making a joke, pointing out something amusing, providing helpful information, or expressing sympathy or concern for a fan. Additionally, a simple thumbs-up or heart can go a long way to demonstrate that you are paying attention even if you aren’t feeling very friendly (we all have bad days, it’s OK!).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094428/7443" target="_top" id="2094428">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094428" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094428/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is-1"><a href="#Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is-1" class="headerlink" title="Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?"></a>Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?</h2><p>A highlighted comment on YouTube aims to draw the content creator’s attention with an automated feature.</p><p>When you click over to the comments area after receiving a notification about a new comment or a reply to one of your comments, that particular comment will be highlighted for quick access.</p><p>To put it another way, YouTube flags notable comments for you to ensure that new messages or significant replies aren’t lost in the noise. Once you have read or replied to the comment, the highlight will go.</p><p>Additionally, video creators can manually highlight commenters to mark them for later responses.

The selection is even difficult for beginners because they are not able to compare services with ease. The article below will help you to get information about detailed comparison of MX and VLC player. Both are well recognised software platforms in players market with little ups and downs on few feature sets.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-MX-and-VLC-Player"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-MX-and-VLC-Player" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of MX and VLC Player"></a>Pros and Cons of MX and VLC Player</h2><p> The list of pros includes many similar kind of offers; they are described as:</p><p><strong><em>Pros:</em></strong></p><ul><li>Both of them follow hardware integration.</li><li>Offer wide range of customization possibilities for user platforms.</li><li>VLC as well as MX extends support to subtitle formats.</li><li>They offer multi support decoding facility.</li><li>Multiple languages are supported for subtitles.</li><li>Both these players support most of the video file formats.</li><li>The audio tracks can be altered dynamically as per need.</li></ul><p> The added advantage to VLC platform is that it handles all media files with smooth processing whereas handy widgets make home screen controls much easier. You can easily manage all media files in its playlist with easy search options.</p><p> MX Player possesses wide range of advanced services like pinch to zoom and it also offers subtitle movement options.</p><p><strong><em>Cons:</em></strong></p><p> If you plan to switch to free version of MX player then you will have to tolerate loads of ads. The only option to get rid of these ads is to pay for the professional version that has additional advanced features. The pro version can definitely ensure high quality content delivery without causing unwanted clutters on screen.</p><p> The only difficulty that you can face with VLC player is that its beta version is not much stable but it is not a big issue for android user because the new update is quite stable and performs better. You will not find pop ads on VLC like MX player.</p><p> One more big difference between VLC and MX is that VLC can assist users in easy network streaming whereas MX lacks in this capability.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118306/7443" target="_top" id="2118306">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118306" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118306/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Detailed-Comparison-of-VLC-and-MX-Player"><a href="#Detailed-Comparison-of-VLC-and-MX-Player" class="headerlink" title="Detailed Comparison of VLC and MX-Player"></a>Detailed Comparison of VLC and MX-Player</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398449/3022" target="_top" id="398449">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398449" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398449/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-User-Interface"><a href="#The-User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="The User Interface"></a>The User Interface</h3><p> Users reviews say that the first appearance of MX player is not so impressive and do not even contain a well designed menu area that is popular in case of VLC. But one must say that MX is perfect choice if you want to stay focused with video content delivery. Other than annoying ads, you will not find any other distraction on its interface.</p><p> In case of VLC, you can definitely enjoy finest screen controls with well managed search menu and it also offers refresh options to stay tuned with updated library. Users can easily switch between audio and video files over VLC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087409/7443" target="_top" id="2087409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087409/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Viewing-Media"><a href="#Viewing-Media" class="headerlink" title="Viewing Media"></a>Viewing Media</h3><p> It is really difficult to prove that any one of these players perform better in terms of viewing media category. Both of these offer great content delivery but you can put VLC on higher side just because of its ability to play videos without cluttering screen with ads. MX keeps on distracting users with so many ads that can even cover your desired video content on screen. You need to make payment to get pro version of MX that is free from ads but VLC is always free with loads of quality features.</p><h3 id="Extra-Features"><a href="#Extra-Features" class="headerlink" title="Extra Features"></a>Extra Features</h3><p> Developers often keep on improving their media player software with advanced features so that viewers can enjoy incredible experience. But in case of VLC you will find least modifications and it appears same from so many years.

But, if you want to have a better experience, you will need more. A research and test results reveal that Periscope requires 10.4 MB for viewing a 2 minutes video on an average that is equal to <strong>5.2MB</strong> per minute.

It weighs down your device making it heavy for any other videos to open. While closing a browser or a tab, the OS deletes thousands of small sized files that are automatically downloaded in order to open the web pages. When you do not close the browsers properly and shut down your device, the files stored automatically weighs down the browser, effecting faster live streaming and loading speed. Thus, prior to doing live streaming, open the browser settings and delete the recently used history and other provisional Internet files in order to increase live streaming speed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129043/19576" target="_top" id="2129043">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129043" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129043/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Connect-WIFI-When-It-Is-Available"><a href="#Part-5-Connect-WIFI-When-It-Is-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Connect WIFI When It Is Available"></a>Part 5: Connect WIFI When It Is Available</h2><p> For any heavy file download or live streaming, mobile data usage can ruin your experience and it is also too much consuming, whether data or time.

This article will explain what a video aspect ratio is, it includes common video aspect ratios you see nowadays, and includes recommended aspect ratios for video on various social media platforms.</p><p>With that said, let’s dive right into it!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio"><a href="#1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a video aspect ratio?"></a>1. What is a video aspect ratio?</h2><p>Aspect ratio is a digital image projection attribute describing the distance between the width and the height of an image. The dimensions are also defined as shapes such as a square which is 4:3. A rectangle represents the 16:9 standard high definition aspect ratio, and inverted what you see on phones, that will be 9:16. 9 refers to the width and 16 to the height.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123750/7443" target="_top" id="2123750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123750/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios"><a href="#2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios" class="headerlink" title="2.

This resolution allows for the vertical display of videos on tablets and phones, meaning that it allows videos to play while the device is being held in its upright position. This works ideally for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts, and more.</p><h3 id="21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen"><a href="#21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="21:9 Cinematic Widescreen"></a>21:9 Cinematic Widescreen</h3><p>The 21:9 resolution is designed for filming ultra-wide screen movies that gives the viewer a theater-like feeling. It’s mostly used to display films and movies in anamorphic formats. Just like on ultra-wide monitors, it allows the video to be shown across the entire screen, giving you a cinema-like experience. This resolution contributes to a broader viewing experience in any shape or form.</p><h2 id="3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose"><a href="#3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose" class="headerlink" title="3.

To give the viewers the best experience, here are the top aspect ratios we recommend when posting content onto your YouTube channel.</p><p>16:9 for YouTube live streams</p><p>9:16 for YouTube Shorts</p><p>16:9 for regular HD videos</p><p>21:9 for cinematic videos&#x2F;shortfilms</p><h3 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h3><p>When talking about Instagram, which is very similar to Facebook, use these aspect ratios to ensure that your quality will be the best of the best.</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Reels</p><p>4:3 for Instagram feed advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Story advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Stories</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Instagram feed videos</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Live streams</p><p>9:16 for IGTV</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148773/18498" target="_top" id="2148773">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148773" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148773/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h3><p>Before Musical.ly users were migrated to a new platform called TikTok in 2018, it has been the leader on the board for a long time, and here are the recommended resolutions we think give the best results. Tik Tok allows you to share short videos, and is used by young people as an outlet to show their talents whether it’s dancing, singing, cooking, comedy or any other form of entertainment they can express and use on the platform. There’s also a feature to work together and collaborate with other Tik Tok creators across the globe.</p><p>16:9 for organic Tik Tok feed videos</p><p>16:9 for Tik Tok live videos</p><p>1:1; 16:9 or 9:16 for TikTok advertisements</p><h2 id="4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video"><a href="#4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video" class="headerlink" title="4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?"></a>4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?</h2><p>A very important point we’d like to mention is that we don’t recommend changing the aspect ratio after filming, because it could harm the video quality and we think it’s best to choose the aspect ratio on your phone or camera before filming, besides that we have some great tips for optimizing your video for the watching experience below.</p><h3 id="Black-bars"><a href="#Black-bars" class="headerlink" title="Black bars"></a>Black bars</h3><p>When editing your video, adding black bars is not changing the aspect ratio as you are just adding black bars to the screen. What we do recommend is cropping the video until you get the desired result.
