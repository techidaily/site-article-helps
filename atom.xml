The very first step is to choose any effect that you want. Then you have to choose a picture or capture one at the moment. Remember that your image is clear; otherwise, the AI can’t recognize and edit it. The drawback while importing is that, by default, the app doesn’t show all your gallery images; instead, the AI finds the most suitable photos according to the selected effect and shows them randomly. However, you can choose the gallery option to select from your gallery. Also, you are only able to select one image at a time. After selecting a photo, you can continue by clicking the create cartoon button.</p><h5 id="Step2-Choose-the-Background"><a href="#Step2-Choose-the-Background" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Choose the Background"></a>Step2 Choose the Background</h5><p>After you’ve created your cartoon picture, the Toon App offers you to add some beautiful backgrounds to it. Select any background to add it. This feature is provided primarily in some effects where the AI removes your original background.</p><h5 id="Step3-Export-to-Gallery-and-Share"><a href="#Step3-Export-to-Gallery-and-Share" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Export to Gallery and Share"></a>Step3 Export to Gallery and Share</h5><p>Now that we’ve successfully edited the picture, you can tap the save button in the next step to export this photo to the gallery. In addition to this, you can also directly post it to different social media platforms using ToonApp sharing options. The overall quality of the picture is good, but to get even better quality, the premium version is required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-4.jpg"                      alt="export to gallery and share"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-ToonApp"><a href="#Part-4-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-ToonApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

However, ToonApp Pro is the only app that offers this capability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-2.jpg"                      alt="full body cartoon"                ></p><h3 id="3-3D-Cartoon-1"><a href="#3-3D-Cartoon-1" class="headerlink" title="3. 3D Cartoon"></a>3. 3D Cartoon</h3><p>This is another excellent feature that ToonApp is offering and is available in a free version. Using this feature, your face will become a 3D cartoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-3.jpg"                      alt="3d cartoon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-ToonApp-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-ToonApp-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to use ToonApp?"></a>Part 3. How to use ToonApp?</h2><p>It’s time to discuss some steps of using the ToonApp:</p><h5 id="Step1-Select-Effect-and-Photo-to-Edit-1"><a href="#Step1-Select-Effect-and-Photo-to-Edit-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Select Effect and Photo to Edit"></a>Step1 Select Effect and Photo to Edit</h5><p>Once you’ve entered the app, six effects will show up. The very first step is to choose any effect that you want. Then you have to choose a picture or capture one at the moment. Remember that your image is clear; otherwise, the AI can’t recognize and edit it. The drawback while importing is that, by default, the app doesn’t show all your gallery images; instead, the AI finds the most suitable photos according to the selected effect and shows them randomly. However, you can choose the gallery option to select from your gallery. Also, you are only able to select one image at a time. After selecting a photo, you can continue by clicking the create cartoon button.</p><h5 id="Step2-Choose-the-Background-1"><a href="#Step2-Choose-the-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Choose the Background"></a>Step2 Choose the Background</h5><p>After you’ve created your cartoon picture, the Toon App offers you to add some beautiful backgrounds to it. Select any background to add it. This feature is provided primarily in some effects where the AI removes your original background.</p><h5 id="Step3-Export-to-Gallery-and-Share-1"><a href="#Step3-Export-to-Gallery-and-Share-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Export to Gallery and Share"></a>Step3 Export to Gallery and Share</h5><p>Now that we’ve successfully edited the picture, you can tap the save button in the next step to export this photo to the gallery. In addition to this, you can also directly post it to different social media platforms using ToonApp sharing options. The overall quality of the picture is good, but to get even better quality, the premium version is required.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/toonapp-review-4.jpg"                      alt="export to gallery and share"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=195080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrwonder/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >With Screensaver Wonder you can easily make a screensaver from your own pictures and video files.

If you don’t want to switch on ToonApp Pro, you can still use its free version with ads and other limitations like the watermark is not removable and some premium effects are not unlocked. But still, it has a lot to entertain you.</p><h4 id="2-Easy-To-Use-1"><a href="#2-Easy-To-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Easy To Use"></a><strong>2.

With this technique, you can capture the dark and light tones in the scenery.</p><p>The science behind it is that the camera captures a scene twice or thrice with different exposures. Then, it combines all the exposures and creates an image that focuses on the dark and the light tones.</p><p>There are different scenarios where HDR photography can be helpful.

It uses the HDR technique to create images from a batch of photos as well as process single images. It has a wide variety of tools that help in getting natural-looking photos.</p><p>An interesting fact about SNS HDR is that it is available in three versions: SNS HDR Pro, SNS HDR Home, and SNS HDR Lite. Each of them has different licenses and provides a different set of features.</p><p>Here we are going to look at SNS HDR Pro and what features it offers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="SNS-HDR-Pro’s-Features"><a href="#SNS-HDR-Pro’s-Features" class="headerlink" title="SNS HDR Pro’s Features"></a>SNS HDR Pro’s Features</h3><p><strong><em>1.</em> <em>Graphical User Interface</em></strong></p><p>SNS HDR Pro has a graphical user interface that makes it really easy for users to get equipped with HDR editing. It has sliders on the right side of the screen that help you adjust different settings. It is pretty user-friendly and does not take much time to get accustomed to.</p><p>Such a user interface is beneficial for new users as they don’t have to put in a lot of effort to get used to it.</p><p><strong><em>2.</em> <em>Batch Processing Module</em></strong></p><p>The next feature of SNS HDR Pro is batch processing. Like most HDR software, SNS HDR Pro also offers batch processing. With the help of this feature, you can add images of multiple exposures so that the software can process them into a single HDR image.</p><p>This is helpful when you take batch photos with your camera. These photos should preferably have different exposures so that you can use SNS HDR’s batch processing feature to combine all the different exposures to get a single picture with all the right tones.</p><p><strong><em>3.</em> <em>Built-in and User Presets</em></strong></p><p>Another cool feature that SNS HDR Pro has is that it provides its users with built-in presets. You can use these presets by clicking on them. They are present on the left side of the screen. As the name suggests, these presets are an already constructed set of settings. When you click on them, those specific settings are applied to the image.</p><p>This is helpful as you do not have to go through the tedious task of adjusting each aspect of the image yourself. If you want to finish your editing quickly, presets are your best option.</p><p>Moreover, you can also create your own presets and save them for future use.</p><p><strong><em>4.</em> <em>Masks</em></strong></p><p>Masking is another feature that SNS HDR Pro offers. Using this feature, you can edit specific parts of your image. Usually, when you add an effect, the whole picture changes according to it.</p><p>With masks, you can highlight an area of the image and edit that area solely without affecting the rest of the image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="User-Reviews"><a href="#User-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="User Reviews"></a>User Reviews</h3><p>Many users worldwide have used SNS HDR Pro and given certain feedback.

A user Darle T. gave a review stating that</p><p><em>“I like that I can use use my HDR app to fix the extreme dynamic range of my TIFFS to create a fairly dull, dynamically flat, but still realistic image.”</em></p><p>Another user mentions</p><p><em>“Very clean blends, natural results, good workflow, batch processing with option for manual input. Great thought-out package.”</em></p><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-to-Edit-and-Deliver-your-HDR-Videos-to-YouTube-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-to-Edit-and-Deliver-your-HDR-Videos-to-YouTube-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How to Edit and Deliver your HDR Videos to YouTube with Wondershare Filmora?"></a>Pro Tip: How to Edit and Deliver your HDR Videos to YouTube with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</h2><p>Although SNS HDR offers excellent features and it also has good reviews, another such tool for HDR videos is Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

With this technique, you can capture the dark and light tones in the scenery.</p><p>The science behind it is that the camera captures a scene twice or thrice with different exposures. Then, it combines all the exposures and creates an image that focuses on the dark and the light tones.</p><p>There are different scenarios where HDR photography can be helpful. Especially in spaces where you have to capture the whole landscape or the true colors of the sky.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/sns-hdr-pro-review-1.jpg"                      alt="hdr photography captures images"                ></p><p>HDR technique is also useful when your camera is not up to mark and does not capture what your eye sees. In this case, you can use a software such as SNS HDR to use HDR editing to make the image as close to reality as possible.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/sns-hdr-pro-review-2.jpg"                      alt="use hdr editing to edit images"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Review-in-Detail-on-SNS-HDR-1"><a href="#Review-in-Detail-on-SNS-HDR-1" class="headerlink" title="Review in Detail on SNS HDR"></a>Review in Detail on SNS HDR</h2><p>Now that you have an idea of how useful the HDR technique can be for you let’s take a detailed look at SNS HDR and its features.</p><p>SNS HDR is a software for processing HDR images to create realistic shots. It uses the HDR technique to create images from a batch of photos as well as process single images. It has a wide variety of tools that help in getting natural-looking photos.</p><p>An interesting fact about SNS HDR is that it is available in three versions: SNS HDR Pro, SNS HDR Home, and SNS HDR Lite. Each of them has different licenses and provides a different set of features.</p><p>Here we are going to look at SNS HDR Pro and what features it offers.</p><h3 id="SNS-HDR-Pro’s-Features-1"><a href="#SNS-HDR-Pro’s-Features-1" class="headerlink" title="SNS HDR Pro’s Features"></a>SNS HDR Pro’s Features</h3><p><strong><em>1.</em> <em>Graphical User Interface</em></strong></p><p>SNS HDR Pro has a graphical user interface that makes it really easy for users to get equipped with HDR editing. It has sliders on the right side of the screen that help you adjust different settings. It is pretty user-friendly and does not take much time to get accustomed to.</p><p>Such a user interface is beneficial for new users as they don’t have to put in a lot of effort to get used to it.</p><p><strong><em>2.</em> <em>Batch Processing Module</em></strong></p><p>The next feature of SNS HDR Pro is batch processing. Like most HDR software, SNS HDR Pro also offers batch processing. With the help of this feature, you can add images of multiple exposures so that the software can process them into a single HDR image.</p><p>This is helpful when you take batch photos with your camera. These photos should preferably have different exposures so that you can use SNS HDR’s batch processing feature to combine all the different exposures to get a single picture with all the right tones.</p><p><strong><em>3.</em> <em>Built-in and User Presets</em></strong></p><p>Another cool feature that SNS HDR Pro has is that it provides its users with built-in presets. You can use these presets by clicking on them. They are present on the left side of the screen. As the name suggests, these presets are an already constructed set of settings. When you click on them, those specific settings are applied to the image.</p><p>This is helpful as you do not have to go through the tedious task of adjusting each aspect of the image yourself. If you want to finish your editing quickly, presets are your best option.</p><p>Moreover, you can also create your own presets and save them for future use.</p><p><strong><em>4.</em> <em>Masks</em></strong></p><p>Masking is another feature that SNS HDR Pro offers. Using this feature, you can edit specific parts of your image. Usually, when you add an effect, the whole picture changes according to it.</p><p>With masks, you can highlight an area of the image and edit that area solely without affecting the rest of the image.</p><h3 id="User-Reviews-1"><a href="#User-Reviews-1" class="headerlink" title="User Reviews"></a>User Reviews</h3><p>Many users worldwide have used SNS HDR Pro and given certain feedback. Among these, we have some really great photographers such Nick Powell from 360 Photography who says that</p><p><em>“I have been using SNS HDR for over 2 years now and I can safely say that it is the best HDR software (in my opinion) that there is on the market today.”</em></p><p>Other users have also commented on different platforms. A user Darle T. gave a review stating that</p><p><em>“I like that I can use use my HDR app to fix the extreme dynamic range of my TIFFS to create a fairly dull, dynamically flat, but still realistic image.”</em></p><p>Another user mentions</p><p><em>“Very clean blends, natural results, good workflow, batch processing with option for manual input. Great thought-out package.”</em></p><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-to-Edit-and-Deliver-your-HDR-Videos-to-YouTube-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-to-Edit-and-Deliver-your-HDR-Videos-to-YouTube-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How to Edit and Deliver your HDR Videos to YouTube with Wondershare Filmora?"></a>Pro Tip: How to Edit and Deliver your HDR Videos to YouTube with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</h2><p>Although SNS HDR offers excellent features and it also has good reviews, another such tool for HDR videos is Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

There is a difference between the two. Do you wish to see a recording for a longer time on screen? The slow-motion videos do exactly the same. A video’s motion is captured at a higher framerate than the actual speed of playback. i.e. the time observation is slowed down. For instance, if you add slow-motion effect to a 2 seconds video, it appears to last longer on the screen.</p><p> Whereas, a timelapse video is a sort of fast-forward. A time span that has lasted for long but while depicting it on screen, you speed up the perception of time or the actual time is the time-lapse.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Now, creating slow-motion videos on your Android is easy and fun with the above-mentioned apps.

However, they need to understand it fully in order to know its potential to the fullest. Marketers need to understand how they can adapt as this world expands and different brands find opportunities to market and sell their products and services. In general, it is a platform suited to market to the Millenials as well as the Gen Zers. These generations are the most avid users of Metaverses. That is mainly pertaining to virtual gaming zones and technologies such as AR and VR.</p><p>Here we explore what <strong>Metaverse marketing</strong> is and what the concept means for brands as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What-Does-Metaverse-Mean-for-Brands"><a href="#Part-3-What-Does-Metaverse-Mean-for-Brands" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Does Metaverse Mean for Brands?"></a>Part 3: What Does Metaverse Mean for Brands?</h2><p>Metaverse is considered as a successor to what the present-day internet offers. Today mobile internet has predominance. This is a different era compared to broadband internet that came by in the nineties as well as in the early part of the new millennium.</p><p>Today there is the convergence of artificial intelligence, cloud processing as well as 5G technologies. These have been attributed to offering a cost-effective and enjoyable VR and AR experience. This is also due to increased connectivity that now exists across different devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-brand-marketing.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Brand Marketing"                ></p><p>Source: venturebeat.com</p><p>Today, the way we consume data and brands has shifted. Metaverse represents a confluence of several things, from social interactions to gaming or even the cryptocurrency universe. Metaverse attempts to blur the lines to create a reality that is used and perceived differently by different people. It sets up a democratised and decentralized space.</p><p>Brands need to remember that Metaverse puts people before. Hence, it provides them an opportunity to present their offerings in a different light or perspective. Metaverse is spaces that are characterized by playfulness, community and creation of values. Brands can embed their services and products in a creative manner in such an environment. It also gives exposure to unexplored audiences without having to worry about real-world outcomes in such an environment.</p><p>One of the pioneers to embrace this concept is Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is CEO of Facebook and he believes that it is the future path forward for his company. His enterprise is about a trillion dollars worth. He believes that it will help expand his social media platforms where people will engage more. It will combine platforms for work, play as well as a platform to socialize at. Indeed, after they changed their name to Meta, the word has been trending across internet portals. It is yet to be seen how Facebook makes the transition to Meta a successful one. This is especially because Facebook is still sorting out some PR legalities. However, Metaverse influencer marketing is another huge gain for this company.</p><p><strong>Learned from Metaverse Marketing Examples</strong></p><p>Here are some examples of Metaverse marketing brands that are embracing the concept of a Metaverse in marketing:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-NASCAR"><a href="#1-NASCAR" class="headerlink" title="1.

This can be a little disappointing, especially when the huge amount of hard work that went into the production of the professional-looking photos is taken into account.</p><p>Until social media networks come up with a better solution for protecting their users from copyright infringements, adding watermarks to your iPhone photos remains the most reliable way of making sure that nobody is going to steal your property.

Among the tools or techniques applicable in achieving this is a “green screen” in filmmaking. A green screen is the actualizing backbone of sci-fi movies and other related scenes in a movie. Green screen is likely the tool used in making the impossible possible in most of the movies you have seen in the past. The green screen works by imitating an easy and straight act of editing and manipulating originally recorded scenes. Some <strong>green screen templates are free</strong>; you do not need to learn video manipulation before you use <strong>green screen templates</strong> in filmmaking.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Green-Screen-templates"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Green-Screen-templates" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Green Screen (templates)"></a>Part 1: What is Green Screen (templates)</h2><p>The green screen is the underlying background for post-production effects in video making. Cinematography has developed: advanced technology is applicable in editing and customizing effects via “computer-generated imagery” (CGI). The CGI is the main tool facilitating video manipulation; however, the green screen is the aiding factor. CGI is not possible without green-screen effects. And this is why green screen templates are inevitable for all video makers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/green_screen.jpg"                      alt="green screen"                ></p><p>Green screen templates are ready-made effects free for use and downloadable. Unlike advanced videography, green screen templates do not require installation or a combination of software. You can use green-screen effects even from Filmora: an online video and image facilitating website.</p><p>Advantages of green screen templates include easy application, smooth editing, beginner-friendly, and cost-efficiency. A simple video editing costs a reasonable amount and effort; however, using a green screen template reduces cost and time. Many green screen templates are free on the web; learning about individual green screen templates and their unique feature improves productivity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-green-screen-templates-on-your-videos"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-green-screen-templates-on-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use green screen templates on your videos"></a>Part 2: How to use green screen templates on your videos</h2><p>Green screen templates are available on reliable sources (for example, Filmora); you can create your green background yourself. The best way to use green screen templates is to apply ready-made templates on a platform; however, there are conditions where the right green template you want is unavailable. In this case, you must create the green screen video yourself.</p><h3 id="2-1-Download-green-screen-templates"><a href="#2-1-Download-green-screen-templates" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Download green screen templates"></a>2.1 Download green screen templates</h3><p>Downloading a suitable green screen template is the first thing to do. Ensure the green screen template fits the original video you want to overlay. Visit a template source, search “green screen” from the search space and select the right video that best represents your need&#x2F;original video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/filmstock_green_screen.jpg"                      alt="filmstock green screen image"                ></p><p>You skip shooting the green background video yourself if you use a template. However, the ready-made video template may reduce quality production if you do not use the right green screen template. Keep the movement and element in mind while selecting a green screen template for your project: ensure the speed&#x2F;movement aligns with the original video elements.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-2-Import-the-video-background-and-green-screen-videos"><a href="#2-2-Import-the-video-background-and-green-screen-videos" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Import the video background and green screen videos"></a>2.2 Import the video background and green screen videos</h3><p>Import the two videos on Filmora: background and green screen; the background video replaces the green screen video.

In spite of improvements to game technology in recent years, HTC is focusing heavily these days on making sure users feel correctly oriented. HTC is also at work on boosting the frame rate to match with the body movements and to clear up that nausea-inducing mismatch. The game developers are coming up with a variety of solutions to solve the problem, or at least minimize it. A new technology introduced by the Mayo Clinic is a good hope for HTC Vive to bring its headsets to a whole new level. The hospital has developed algorithms that, when paired with galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), can trick the brain into syncing what you’re seeing in VR with physical stimulation within a tenth of a second.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Tips-to-reduce-motion-sickness"><a href="#8-Tips-to-reduce-motion-sickness" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to reduce motion sickness"></a>8 Tips to reduce motion sickness</h2><p> Listed below are some ways to reduce motion sickness while using your virtual reality headset.</p><ul><li>Avoid playing racing games or any other game that rapidly throws you around.</li><li>Eating right before using VR tends to increase motion sickness as well. Ignore that.</li><li>You can actually ‘build up’ a tolerance over time and be less susceptible to motion sickness once you get used to it.</li><li>Search for field of view options. Lower fields of view help with motion sickness</li><li>Ginger tablets aid with nausea and motion sickness</li><li>After you have had a motion sickness, sleeping is best because it lets your inner ears completely reset themselves.</li><li>Just before putting on the HTC Vive headset, consume a couple of beers, sounds like a weird option but some people have reported it doing wonders for them.</li><li>Getting a bad frame rate can also make you easily sick, if you get yourself a beefy computer nausea can be reduced.</li></ul><p>**Warning:**These quick remedies work from person to person. Thus the best thing to do as soon as you feel the slightest tinge of nausea, stop what you’re doing and remove the headset. Don’t re-enter VR until you aren’t feeling sick anymore. Thinking you can “tough it out” will leave you feeling dizzy and nauseated for hours and trust me it’s not worth it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

This 4K smartphone is not mobile friendly with its thick bezels to and bottom design, makes it mimic the outlook of a dated device. Such lag would have been considerably entertained if it wasn’t the latest flagship of Sony but because it is, it looks awkward to overlook such lag.</p><p>The Xperia XZ Premium is uncomfortable to hold because of its large size and its sharp corner. If you want to use it one-handed, you will find it is hard for you to reach upper screen and the corners will dig into your palm. Though Sony adopted Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back, the rear glass on this XZ Premium is unbelievable slippery. Any angle will cause it to slide.</p><p>On the left side of the XZ Premium, there are a dual-SIM and microSD card slot which are accessible through a flap. This phone is charged via a USB-C port which supporting Quick Charge 3.0. The fingerprint sensor is intergrated with the power button, however, it is disabled in the US.</p><h4 id="2-Display"><a href="#2-Display" class="headerlink" title="2.Display"></a>2.Display</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-xperia-xz-premium-display.jpg"                      alt="sony-xperia-xz-premium-display"                ></p><p>The Sony XZ Premium has a great and awesome display, which earned it the day world’s first 5.5 inches device with (3,840-by-2,160) HDR IPS display smartphone. It is the first smartphone with a 4K HDR display in the world. In case you cannot decipher the math properly, this means a wholesome of 807 pixels per inch. One more thing is that; unlike preceding devices which has a stumped up view of the 4k display, this device runs the 4k experience on all section of the device.</p><p>However the great testimony about this device, we have one complaint about the panel. The color of this panel is somehow unrealistic. In spite of the fact that it does feature three display presets, which you can choose from in order to change the way color are displayed. Either: super vivid, standard, and or professional mode. While the professional mode is meant to present the best display mode, the sky-like over saturated hue is somewhat weird. Nevertheless you can still custom switch between them.</p><h4 id="3-Hardware"><a href="#3-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="3.Hardware"></a>3.Hardware</h4><p>For the time being, this Sony seems to be the first mobile manufacturer to have announced the Snapdragon 835. Apart from this imaginable processor, the XZ Premium also comes with a 4GB RAM, which makes it pretty much-performing phone.</p><p>Thinking about these customizations, one would reasonably conclude that it will be another oven. But surprisingly, this device seems to be an opposite of rational assumptions. It also comes with a 64GB storage, which is expandable with a MicroSD.</p><h4 id="4-Resistant-Capacity"><a href="#4-Resistant-Capacity" class="headerlink" title="4.Resistant Capacity"></a>4.Resistant Capacity</h4><p>One more positive with the XZ Premium is with its IP68 dust and water resistance, which leaves you with the confidence of using your phone anywhere without being scared of it absorbing liquid.</p><h4 id="5-Connectivity"><a href="#5-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="5. Connectivity"></a>5. Connectivity</h4><p>The phone has a strong and reliable internet and network connectivity. One of the recently test done in Midtown Manhattan, a solid network connectivity was recorded with an optimal download speed of 11.41 mbps.</p><p>Such level of connectivity that comes with this phone is also related with the fact that it supports Cat 16 LTE with a 4x4 MIMO, which allows it attains gigabit download speed. In addition, it also supports dual-band, Wi-Fi and NFC.</p><h4 id="6-Battery"><a href="#6-Battery" class="headerlink" title="6. Battery"></a>6.

However, it is still a more sufficient capacity. The battery life is somehow disappointing. This is related to the fact that the phone consumes a lot of power especially when you are playing games and real-time usage. However the disappointing battery life, it can be very good for everyday use if you can have a better usage, like turning off the Wi-Fi when not in use and some other features like your data and Bluetooth. Meanwhile the phone has an unprecedented fast charging technology that supports the 3.0 charging tech, which might leave you less worried about the battery life as it takes no longer time to sip it in again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Section-2-Interface-Layout"><a href="#Section-2-Interface-Layout" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Interface Layout"></a>Section 2: Interface Layout</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-xperia-xz-premium-software.jpg"                      alt="sony-xperia-xz-premium-software"                ></p><p>Sony XZ Premium support the latest Android 7.1.1 interface. The interface is quite pretty easy to navigate and use. If you have been a Sony user, then this will give you no heck as it is possible to get used to the interface and how they function within some hours. The interface is pleasing and sight beautifying, as well as intuitive and fantasizing.</p><p>As known over the years, one thing Sony has long been known for is with their preinstalled applications. This Sony XZ premium comes with some pre-installed app which will give you a reliable feel of the device as some of these apps cannot be gotten for free. So you are given the custom ability to enjoy the device as part of your purchase. One other thing here is that you are not compelled to make use of these apps incase, some may not be suitable to you, you can disable it any time you like.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Section-3-Features-and-Performance-of-Sony-Xperia-XZ-Premium-4K-Smartphone"><a href="#Section-3-Features-and-Performance-of-Sony-Xperia-XZ-Premium-4K-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Section 3: Features and Performance of Sony Xperia XZ Premium 4K Smartphone"></a>Section 3: Features and Performance of Sony Xperia XZ Premium 4K Smartphone</h3><h4 id="1-Camera-Performance"><a href="#1-Camera-Performance" class="headerlink" title="1.Camera Performance"></a>1.Camera Performance</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-xperia-xz-premium-camera.jpg"                      alt="sony-xperia-xz-premium-camera"                ></p><p>Some major dimensions of the XZ premium that need to be noted is the camera quality. The phone comes with a 19MP back camera and the front camera also has a competitive 13MP with crisp selfies, which is also awesome for real time video chat.</p><p>The picture quality of the XZ Premium is something that is remarkable.

But note that you will need huge storage capacity to work with all advanced features of this camera so here is a need to go through available memory cards. Note that Sony A7S II is highly dependent upon type of memory card and when it find that memory card is not meeting desired requirements then card type it simply disables few important features. It is good to ensure that you have bought right card so that your camera can function properly.</p><p> The article below can help you to select right memory cards for your Sony A7S II camera:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3546200&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.binteko.com/sites/default/files/banner01_468x60a.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-choose-the-right-memory-card-for-your-Sony-A7S-II"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-memory-card-for-your-Sony-A7S-II" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right memory card for your Sony A7S II"></a>How to choose the right memory card for your Sony A7S II</h2><h4 id="Section-1-UHS-Ultra-High-Speed-Card-Classification"><a href="#Section-1-UHS-Ultra-High-Speed-Card-Classification" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: UHS (Ultra High Speed) Card Classification"></a>Section 1: UHS (Ultra High Speed) Card Classification</h4><p> You will find few memory cards with Ultra High Speed (UHS) classifications that determine maximum reading speed of your card. Presently, you can find two major types of UHS classifications as UHS-I and USH-II where the first one is rated to serve at 104MB&#x2F;s and second one serves at 312 MB&#x2F;s. It simply means that footage in USH-II cards can be offloaded 3x faster but to maintain this speed you need to have a fast connection and fast hard drive.</p><h4 id="Section-2-Requirements-for-Sony-A7S-II-Memory-Card"><a href="#Section-2-Requirements-for-Sony-A7S-II-Memory-Card" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Requirements for Sony A7S II Memory Card"></a>Section 2: Requirements for Sony A7S II Memory Card</h4><h4 id="1-Card-Type-SDXC"><a href="#1-Card-Type-SDXC" class="headerlink" title="1. Card Type: SDXC"></a>1. Card Type: SDXC</h4><p> The SDXC card technology was launched in 2010 to serve the requirements of full HD recordings with higher speed and capacity. However, these cards follow dimensions comparable to SD as well as SDHC cards but they can support only SDXC devices. You can find these cards ranging from 64GB memory capacity to 2TB and the speed variation goes from 104MB&#x2F;s to 300MB&#x2F;s respectively.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>These cards provide higher storage capacities ranging between 64GB to 2TB.</li><li>Its exFAT type file support allows users to work with large files with higher bitrates.</li></ul><h4 id="2-Speed-Class-Rating-U3"><a href="#2-Speed-Class-Rating-U3" class="headerlink" title="2. Speed Class Rating: U3"></a>2. Speed Class Rating: U3</h4><p> Some of the common specifications that manufacturers provide with their cards are write speed limits and burst read details but both of these cannot help user to get right card for their 4K video needs. Actually the ratio between burst rate and speed does not follow a simple relation thus the best idea is to buy cards by checking their speed class rating. This speed class rating shows that your card will not reduce its writing speed below the specified speed class limit. Some of the most popular peed class ratings available in market are Class 10, U3, U1, Class 6 and Class 4.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>The U3 or UHS speed class 3 cards are designed to serve compatible speed rates for A7S II cameras.</li><li>They can maintain minimum write speed value of 30MB&#x2F;s.</li><li>These cards can record details very smoothly without missing any frame in between.</li></ul><h4 id="3-Card-Capacity"><a href="#3-Card-Capacity" class="headerlink" title="3. Card Capacity"></a>3. Card Capacity</h4><p> As advanced 4k recording cameras like A7S II are designed to work with high capacity cards so the best idea is to buy a card with 64GB capacity so that all frames can be processed without any loss in information. In order to get best results for your classic 4k recordings always prefer to pick a card with higher rating. When you buy a card with higher capacity:</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>You will be able to minimize the risks of sudden card failures. Because when cards are not able to support higher bitrates then they often lose most of the information. It is good to choose a card that can easily record footage up to 1 or 2 hours.</li><li>Note that there is no money saving deal in memory card price ranges. When you go to buy a 128GB memory card it will naturally cost same as if you buy two 64GB cards.</li><li>The SD cards are small sized, compact units so whether you carry a 64GB card in your pocket or choose a 128GB package, none of these are going to put additional weight on your pocket.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803115/14559" target="_top" id="1803115"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803115"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803115/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Memory-Cards-for-Sony-A7S-II"><a href="#Best-Memory-Cards-for-Sony-A7S-II" class="headerlink" title="Best Memory Cards for Sony A7S II"></a>Best Memory Cards for Sony A7S II</h2><h4 id="1-Sony-64GB-High-Performance-Class-10-UHS-1-U3-SDXC"><a href="#1-Sony-64GB-High-Performance-Class-10-UHS-1-U3-SDXC" class="headerlink" title="1.

These days, Polaroid cameras have been replaced by various smartphones and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K DSLR cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Nevertheless, you can digitize your photos in either of the following ways so that you can convert them into softcopy and easily move them around.</p><h4 id="1-Use-your-Smartphones-or-Digital-Cameras"><a href="#1-Use-your-Smartphones-or-Digital-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="1. Use your Smartphones or Digital Cameras"></a>1. Use your Smartphones or Digital Cameras</h4><p>This is something that you might have thought of doing before as well. We all use smartphones to take pictures, but have you ever thought of using the device’s camera to scan your old photographs. The same can be done by using any digital camera too.</p><p>Just make sure that you have proper lighting and all the pictures are organized. Now, just use your smartphone camera to take their pictures. Later, you can connect your phone (or its SD card) to your computer and transfer these scanned copies to any secure location. If you want, you can also upload your photos to the cloud to keep them safe.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Scanner"><a href="#2-Use-a-Scanner" class="headerlink" title="2. Use a Scanner"></a>2. Use a Scanner</h4><p>If you have access to a scanner, then it would make it pretty easy for you to digitize photos. Most of the digital scanners won’t even cost that much. Therefore, if you have a lot of pictures to scan, then you can just buy a scanner. You can also find a scanner available at a nearby digital store that you can use on a per-copy basis.</p><p>Once you have scanned your photos, you can transfer them to a pen drive or move them to any other device of your choice.</p><h4 id="3-Use-a-Photo-Scanner-App"><a href="#3-Use-a-Photo-Scanner-App" class="headerlink" title="3. Use a Photo Scanner App"></a>3. Use a Photo Scanner App</h4><p>There are also tons of readily available apps that you can use on your Android or iOS devices to digitize photos. You can just go to the App Store or Play Store on your device to browse the available scanner apps (most of them are free).</p><p>Some popular photo scanners that you can consider using are Scanner Pro, PhotoScan, ShoeBox, or PicScanner. Out of them, PhotoScan by Google is one of the most reliable options that I would recommend. It will help you easily scan your photos, edit them accordingly, and minimize their glare. You can also directly load your scanned pictures to your Google Photos account from here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photo-scanner-app.jpg"                      alt="Photo Scanner App"                ></p><h4 id="4-Get-in-Touch-with-a-Professional"><a href="#4-Get-in-Touch-with-a-Professional" class="headerlink" title="4.

After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.</p><h3 id="3-Sliding-text-animation"><a href="#3-Sliding-text-animation" class="headerlink" title="3.

Common Types of Text Animation</h2><p>Here is the list of the common types of text animations that you usually see on social media videos as well as video streaming platforms. Using these common text animation types, various interesting and innovative text animations are created.</p><h3 id="1-Parallax-scrolling-1"><a href="#1-Parallax-scrolling-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Parallax scrolling"></a>1. Parallax scrolling</h3><p>Parallax scrolling is a popular visual effect whereby the background stays the same while the foreground shifts horizontally. In a text animation, the parallax scrolling effect is where the background box moves from bottom to top and vice versa but the text stays the same all the time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Fade-in-and-fade-out-1"><a href="#2-Fade-in-and-fade-out-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Fade in and fade out"></a>2. Fade in and fade out</h3><p>Fade in and fade out text animation is extremely common in videos where the text slowly appears on the screen and its color brightness increase slowly. After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.</p><h3 id="3-Sliding-text-animation-1"><a href="#3-Sliding-text-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Sliding text animation"></a>3. Sliding text animation</h3><p>You must have noticed the sliding text animation in videos where facts and figures are shown on the video. The sliding text animation generally slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. Thereafter, it vanishes into the border or the stripe from where it originated. Sometimes, the text slides in from the right and sits in a fixed highlighted box, and slides out eventually.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713322&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVRadio1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV Radio Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Text-breaks-away-animation-1"><a href="#4-Text-breaks-away-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

That text appears on the video and it shatters and disappears. Sometimes, the text turns into dust after shattering like a glass. This text effect cum animation is highly impactful in getting the attention of the viewers immediately.</p><h3 id="5-Typing-text-animation-1"><a href="#5-Typing-text-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Typing text animation"></a>5. Typing text animation</h3><p>Referred to as typewriter text animation as well, the characters in a word or sentence appear on the screen one by one as if someone is typing it in real-time. There is always a cursor blinking at the end of the character and it shifts with the appearance of the words and sentences. Instead of showing words or sentences all at once, showing text as if someone is typing it on the screen is more visually pleasing.</p><h3 id="6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text-1"><a href="#6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text"></a>6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text</h3><p>Last but not least, the vertical scrolling text effect is extremely common for opening and closing credits in movies. This is even used in modern short videos to show credits as well as information as per requirements. Along with vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling text is quite common these days to show a few lines of text instead of showing them together in a paragraph.</p><h2 id="Part-2-8-Interesting-Text-Animation-Examples-1"><a href="#Part-2-8-Interesting-Text-Animation-Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples"></a>Part 2. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples</h2><p>You should always keep the basic and the common types of text animations in mind and come up with interesting and creative text animations.

In this animation, the words seem to get morphed into one another. So, the first word will morph into the second word for the second word to appear on the screen and the sequence continues. The animation can be done fast to showcase multiple words in a short time period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/morphing-text-animation.jpg"                      alt="morphing text animation"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Combined-Slide-Out-Animation-1"><a href="#2-Combined-Slide-Out-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Combined Slide Out Animation"></a>2. Combined Slide Out Animation</h3><p>Generally, in a slide out text animation, the text comes out of a border and the animation type remains the same throughout. However, in the modified slide out animation, the text comes out of the border but it can come out of the top, the side, as well as both sides of the border. The border can also animate to move from the side to the top as well as be placed obliquely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/combined-slide-out-animation.jpg"                      alt="combined slide out animation"                ></p><h3 id="3-The-Stomp-Animation-1"><a href="#3-The-Stomp-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="3. The Stomp Animation"></a>3. The Stomp Animation</h3><p>The stomp effect is quite eye-catching due to its dynamic nature. In this animation, the words come out from another word till the entire sentence is displayed. For example, you have a sentence of four words to display. So, you should show the first word and the second word will come out of the first word and the sequence will continue. If you have two words, you can show them coming out of one another from the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-stomp-animation.jpg"                      alt="the stomp animation"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Curtain-Animation-1"><a href="#4-The-Curtain-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="4. The Curtain Animation"></a>4. The Curtain Animation</h3><p>In this animation, the moving boxes will slide in and slide out and in the process, they will reveal the text hidden behind them. It looks similar to parting the curtain and getting a view. Thereafter, the boxes will slide back in and cover up the text. The sequence will continue to reveal new texts as required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-curtain-animation.jpg"                      alt="the curtain animation"                ></p><h3 id="5-Animated-Text-Outline-Effect-1"><a href="#5-Animated-Text-Outline-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Animated Text Outline Effect"></a>5. Animated Text Outline Effect</h3><p>This is one of the stunning After Effects text animation examples whereby the outline of the text is made to animate with different colors so that the text becomes eye-catching. The text fill color should stay the same as the background so that only the outline is visible and the outline will be moving around one another.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animated-outline-effect.jpg"                      alt="animated outline effect"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Animated-Text-Fill-Effect-1"><a href="#6-Animated-Text-Fill-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Animated Text Fill Effect"></a>6. Animated Text Fill Effect</h3><p>This is one of the most popular GSAP text animation examples whereby you display a sentence with bold style and a color should be moving across the characters in the text. The animated text fill will stay within the characters and should not spill out in the background. The background should be dark for better focus and attention grabbing. Sometimes, people make the color roll from left to right or the text can have a gradient color with the color waving up and down.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animated-text-fill-effect.jpg"                      alt="animated text fill effect"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Neon-Light-Animation-1"><a href="#7-Neon-Light-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="7.

The amount of music and videos being made is much higher than ever. Due to this, the budget range is quite broad and can be quite confusing for first-timers. Although some people use record labels to pay for their music videos, others pay out-of-pocket.</p><p>When shooting a music video, you have to recognize that a lot goes into shooting the music video. It goes beyond the artist and includes the crew members who would show up to make it happen. There are also different aspects to consider when determining how much you need to shoot a music video. Luckily, we’re here to break down how much it will cost to shoot a music video for you. Then, you can use the information shared here to start planning your next music video.</p><p><strong>How Much Will It Cost to Shoot a Music Video?</strong></p><p>We’re noticing a shift in the music video category, with more people choosing to release video singles over audio singles. Additionally, several video-sharing platforms encourage artists to share and promote themselves in creative ways. However, how much will it cost to shoot a music video? Below is how you can determine the answer to that.</p><p><strong>Creating a Budget</strong></p><p>The budget for your music video usually covers pre-production, concept development, casting, storyboards, choreography, location fee, rehearsal, production equipment, on-camera talent, props, costumes, post-production, editing, and many more.

Production costs like the length, concept, location, and the actions you would like to take in the video can significantly change the cost. Additionally, you have to factor in the extra costs like crew, casts, transportation, feeding, etc. However, if you want a music video professionally edited from start to finish, Wondershare Filmora doesn’t just help you cut costs; it also ensures you get an enhanced music video result at the end.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"
