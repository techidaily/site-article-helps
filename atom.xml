In this protracted creative process, color grading is typically the final and possibly at least one of the most crucial processes. We all hoped there’s a way to speed up this procedure, and fortunately there is! Let’s start!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-How-to-install-LUTs-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#1-How-to-install-LUTs-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. How to install LUTs in Premiere Pro"></a>1. How to install LUTs in Premiere Pro</h2><p>LUTs can be applied in Premiere Pro in two different ways. Utilizing LUTs through the Creative tab of the Lumetri Color Panel is the simplest method. However, it does not make the LUTs a permanent part of the collection.</p><p>Step1Download your LUTs bundle, then unzip it to get the LUTs out. Find and copy the.Cube format files. They are the 3D LUTs file format.</p><p>Step2Locate the Lumetri LUTs folder in your Premiere Pro installation directory (for example, C: Program Files&#x2F;AdobePremiere Pro CC&#x2F;LumetriLUTSCreative).</p><p>Step3Paste all of your fresh LUTs in this folder at this time. Your new LUTs will now show up in the Lumetri Color Panel when you launch Premiere Pro (or restart the software if it was already open). Innovative &gt;&gt; Looks</p><h2 id="2-How-to-add-LUTs-to-your-footage"><a href="#2-How-to-add-LUTs-to-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="2. How to add LUTs to your footage"></a>2. How to add LUTs to your footage</h2><p>Step1Choose the Color Workspace at the top after your clip is in the timeline and prepared for grading.</p><p>Step2Click OK after selecting New Item &gt; Adjustment Layer in the Project window’s bottom left corner. The adjustment layer will show up in your project window in step three. It can then be dropped on the track above your video by clicking and dragging it onto the timeline. To make sure it covers the entire piece of film, click, and drag.</p><p>Step3The first Basic Correction option in the right-hand panel of Lumetri Color is Input LUT. Choose this, click Browse, and then go to the location where your LUTs are stored.</p><p>Step4Double-click the LUT you wish to use once you’ve located it, and it will be applied immediately.A tiny tip I like to use occasionally is to find the Effect Controls panel on the left side, then click the drop-down arrow next to Opacity, and make adjustments if you input your LUT and feel that it’s too intense.</p><h2 id="3-Why-use-LUTs-in-your-project"><a href="#3-Why-use-LUTs-in-your-project" class="headerlink" title="3. Why use LUTs in your project?"></a>3. Why use LUTs in your project?</h2><p>When there is no time limit or restriction on when to submit the result file, it is fun to edit your own clips because you have complete creative control over the process. Because of this, Color Grading is a rather unimportant aspect to worry about. After making a few adjustments to the Exposure and Contrast settings, you should be good to go.</p><p>Your finished product, when paired with the appropriate color scheme, has the power to create the atmosphere you want for the video, but managing that aspect of the project can be challenging at times.</p><p>Because of this, some designers employ look-up tables (LUTs) that they have created themselves or something that is currently available on the internet and is ready to install and use.</p><p>When it comes to working on a project for a customer that has a stringent deadline to fulfill, poor color grading could result in a negative impression of your work. This is the case even if everything from the sound effects to the video effects is done to a high standard and is done well.</p><h2 id="4-Can-you-adjust-the-strength-of-the-LUT"><a href="#4-Can-you-adjust-the-strength-of-the-LUT" class="headerlink" title="4. Can you adjust the strength of the LUT?"></a>4. Can you adjust the strength of the LUT?</h2><p>There are no such modifications that can be made in a certain LUT or Look, and there is no reason to adjust them because there is no need to. However, you may change its strength, which is essentially the same thing as the opacity of the LUT that was applied, and there are still choices to color grade the entire movie after the LUT has been applied.</p><p>The entire color panel in Premiere Pro is packed with all of the color grading tools that are required to adjust your film in the appropriate way. Investigating them can provide you with some understanding of how they function. You can get a sense of how these LUTs function by using the pre-installed LUTs that are accessible in Premiere Pro, which you can use at first to get a feel for the LUTs before moving on to using paid or free Color Grading profiles.</p><p>The end outcome does not vary by a substantial amount, but how it looks can change depending on the LUT you use. In the event that something seems to be lacking, you can always modify the color grading.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120864/26400?prodsku=Mercury" target="_top" id="2120864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120864/26400?prodsku=Mercury"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Export-LUTs"><a href="#5-Export-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="5. Export LUTs"></a>5. Export LUTs</h2><p>An awesome feature of Premiere Pro enables you store and reuse your color modifications in multiple projects or programs. You have the option of exporting color grading information as either a.look file or a .cube LUT file, which may then be used in Adobe Premiere Pro or another application. Here’s how you export them:</p><p>Click on the pop-up menu labeled “Lumetri Color,” then select one of the following options:</p><p>Step1”.look” exports color adjustments as a Lumetri file. Exporting “.look” File containing a Look preset, saved in the.look format.</p><p>Step2Export “.cube” This function exports lookup tables in the.cube format so that they can be imported into other color grading programs.</p><p>Step3Store Preset: You can personalize the settings for each color effect, then save the resulting combinations as presets. Within the Save Preset dialog box, give your preset the name you want it to have. If desired, enter a description. Please visit the article on how to create and store an effect preset for further details.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135413/19272" target="_top" id="2135413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135413/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Where-can-you-find-LUTs"><a href="#6-Where-can-you-find-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="6. Where can you find LUTs?"></a>6. Where can you find LUTs?</h2><p>You might be asking, “Now that I’ve learned more about LUTs (Lookup Tables), where can I get even more LUTs?” since you’ve gained some new knowledge. In the end, being able to use the built-in LUTs in Luminar is a nice feature, but these are merely samples of the thousands upon thousands of LUTs that are accessible, both for free and for purchase.</p><ul><li>Osiris Cinematic LUTs</li><li>Finishing LUTs</li><li>DELUTS</li><li>Filmic Tone LUTs</li><li>Luminar</li><li>Complete Cinema LUTs</li><li>Filmic Tone LUTs</li><li>Urban Dark Creative LUTs</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Additionally, check to see if you have inadvertently downloaded any viruses. There is a strong temptation to simply conduct a search for cinematic LUTs on Google, then download all free files that we come across.</p><p>Sometimes, some of them are out there to steal your money rather than provide the color correcting settings that you desire. One other thing that could have been wrong is if your LUT files were placed in the incorrect folder. Please ensure that this is not the case by performing a second check.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-rating-7-of-the-ultimate-waterproof-recorder-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Rating #7 of the Ultimate Waterproof Recorder Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-power-of-language-20-words-and-phrases-that-transform-your-marketing/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Power of Language 20 Words and Phrases That Transform Your Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-smiling-photos-and-videos-iphones/"><u>[New] Smiling Photos & Videos (iPhones)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-the-echo-chamber-of-creativity-crafting-compelling-podcast-stories/"><u>[New] The Echo Chamber of Creativity Crafting Compelling Podcast Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-why-filmora-stands-out-its-top-10-alluring-features/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Why Filmora Stands Out Its Top 10 Alluring Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/bypassing-control-panel-how-to-remove-hidden-software-on-your-pc/"><u>Bypassing Control Panel: How to Remove Hidden Software on Your PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fake-gps-on-oppo-reno-9a-for-mobile-legends-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Fake GPS On Oppo Reno 9A For Mobile Legends? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/resolving-display-driver-problems-for-lg-monitors-across-multiple-windows-versions/"><u>Resolving Display Driver Problems for LG Monitors Across Multiple Windows Versions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/subtitled-quickly-converting-from-compressed-files/"><u>Subtitled Quickly!

An enormous foundation that retorts to steps. The join allows to duck, though, how relaxed will it feel to be sit in such a “chair,” particularly when playing some games like GTA? It is compatible with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. For those users who are absolute to pre-order, these products should know that the problem of space is not a problem anymore. But the foundation of the treadmill machine looks too dense, particularly in judgment with Cyberith.</p><p>It is rated at $699 for pre-order on the certified website of the product. While engaging an order, one must specify the size of the shoe that arises with the set. And also, there are accessible numerous accessories and plug-in apparatuses for the treadmill machines from $60 to $80.</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 8 Best VR Controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Mobile VR headsets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top Virtual Reality (VR) Bikes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><h3 id="2-Cyberith-Virtualizer"><a href="#2-Cyberith-Virtualizer" class="headerlink" title="2.

The podium here is lesser bulky, and the steps are pursued by the motion sensors. Bowing actions can be achieved more usual due to the opportunity in order to lean on one lap, lacking risk to hurt it. The assembly itself is more moveable, which is the reason it is more attractive, particularly in view of its dimensions. It is also compatible with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. The lighter structure, and, the very idea of the treadmill guises more auspicious. It is minor, its working technique is based on gliding, not on the crusade of the platform. if the idea of the surface will turn out to be as easy as simple walking, Virtualizer will be the leading product. Furthermore, the device does not need any special shoes, excluding one purchase. There is no official price yet, because of the non-existence of bulk shipment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977004">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977004">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977004%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977004/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-KatWalk"><a href="#3-KatWalk" class="headerlink" title="3.

A superior fascination is located in the higher part of the structure and will defend the user from dwindling. The procedure of walking does not have a gliding effect, the interaction with the surface is automatic, as present in the Omni. For sure the user will need extra shoes that are given in the form of somewhat weighty shoes. Certainly a questionable prototypical, but it got the utmost considerable funding outside Kickstarter amongst all the others products. The price is unknown yet because of no bulk production.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134249/18498" target="_top" id="2134249">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134249" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134249/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Spacewalker-VR"><a href="#4-Spacewalker-VR" class="headerlink" title="4.

The hardware structures a spinning treadmill, derived by a gyroscope that wits the user’s actions. Weight sensors beneath the platform notice differences in foot pressure to regulate its power feedback. Apart from its application in the VR, this can also be used as a normal treadmill for aptness training. The SpaceWalkerVR is presently in the prototyping phase and is probable to back the Oculus Rift. Its extra Fantastic Engine provision is predictable to open up SpaceWalkerVR’s apps in virtual gaming surroundings.</p><h3 id="5-Infinadeck"><a href="#5-Infinadeck" class="headerlink" title="5.

It bids the sensation of usual action of jogging, running, or walking in the real life by powering the set of treadmills in any of the direction.</p><h2 id="Why-we-need-VR-treadmills-and-What-is-it"><a href="#Why-we-need-VR-treadmills-and-What-is-it" class="headerlink" title="Why we need VR treadmills and What is it?"></a>Why we need VR treadmills and What is it?</h2><p>You have tried the experience of VR headset and happiness, enjoyment, and bright emotions are what you are certainly going to feel just after 10 minutes of sitting in that chair and relishing some preview provided by the developers. Now, stop your eruption of ecstasy attended by tears of pleasure and then think about a more thoughtful game. An object which is useful in the daily life and for the health purposes as well. Just imagine you are running on the great wall of china, or in the streets of the Antarctica. Isn’t it a great feeling to enjoy such walk. Virtual reality treadmills provide such experiences right in your home. There are two benefits provided by the VR treadmills when you run on this treadmill you feel like running at the most beautiful locations in the world and your health gets better.</p><h2 id="How-Do-VR-treadmills-Work"><a href="#How-Do-VR-treadmills-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do VR treadmills Work?"></a>How Do VR treadmills Work?</h2><p>As a gamer, you would know that safe, and special shoes will offer the most relaxed experience from running around in VR worlds.

Though many will ponder even these benefits a luxury, and some of them just cannot or will not want to kill opponents with a plastic rummage that comes within the set. The camera alignment is immovable for the treadmill and the helmet as well, but there is only one snag. In such games where the user can turn his head discretely from the body the feature will work accordingly, but in the mainstream of up-to-date shooters, it will turn out to be one more “backstab”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-basic-to-breathtaking-storytelling-through-smart-bokeh-use/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved From Basic to Breathtaking Storytelling Through Smart Bokeh Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-game-changing-impact-of-freesync-on-lgs-ud68-monitors/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Game-Changing Impact of FreeSync on LG's UD68 Monitors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ultimate-quick-view-windows-photos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Ultimate Quick View - Windows Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-from-monochrome-to-vibrancy-top-11-video-coloring-strategies/"><u>[New] From Monochrome to Vibrancy Top 11 Video Coloring Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-a-compreayers-guide-to-video-refinement-from-standard-definition-to-dynamic-range-zenith/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, A Compreayer's Guide to Video Refinement From Standard Definition to Dynamic Range Zenith</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-laugh-ledger-pinpointing-prime-meme-generators-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Laugh Ledger Pinpointing Prime Meme Generators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-seamless-tweet-integration-on-facebook-platform/"><u>2024 Approved Seamless Tweet Integration on Facebook Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-creative-potential-smart-b-roll-incorporation/"><u>2024 Approved Unlock Creative Potential Smart B Roll Incorporation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-unlock-apple-iphone-15-plus-without-passcode-or-face-id-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>3 Ways to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus without Passcode or Face ID | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/experience-next-gen-television-with-the-sony-xbr4-groovy-x900f-a-4k-uhd-marvel-on-a-49-screen/"><u>Experience Next-Gen Television with the Sony XBR4 Groovy X900F - A 4K UHD Marvel on a 49 Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/immediate-screenshot-on-a-mac-for-2024/"><u>Immediate Screenshot on a MAC for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fix-apple-iphone-7-plus-find-my-friends-no-location-found-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Fix Apple iPhone 7 Plus Find My Friends No Location Found? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-experts-list-of-top-vector-stock-portals/"><u>In 2024, The Expert's List of Top Vector Stock Portals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-depth-assessment-gopro-silver-hero4-sliver-for-2024/"><u>In-Depth Assessment GoPro Silver Hero4 Sliver for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/synthesis-of-song-elements-the-crossfade-approach/"><u>Synthesis of Song Elements The Crossfade Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/upcoming-samsung-galaxy-s25-release-dates-pricing-and-feature-leaks-unveiled/"><u>Upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 - Release Dates, Pricing & Feature Leaks Unveiled</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.</p><p>Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily. The titles and texts are shown with animation for better traction. However, there are many professional video creators who prefer voiceover instead of showing texts as voiceover gives a life to the video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137972/21526" target="_top" id="2137972">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137972" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137972/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>You need to have all the above-mentioned video effects and audio options in the video editor that you choose to make your video highlights.

Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross</h2><p>When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.</p><p>Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily. The titles and texts are shown with animation for better traction.

Picsart has a range of funny blur effects that you can apply to your image and have a whale of a time. These effects do not mirror reality but give your picture a cinematic look. Follow the steps above, but when you get to the part where you tap Effects and have selected the Blur options, opt for a different blur filter.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s look at some funny blur effects in Picsart that you might want to try.</p><h4 id="Motion-Blur"><a href="#Motion-Blur" class="headerlink" title="Motion Blur"></a>Motion Blur</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-4.png"                      alt="funny blur effects in picsart - motion blur"                ></p><p>As the name suggests, this funny blur effect looks amazing on pictures of vehicles and people in motion. All you have to do is apply the filter, then use the adjustment slider to decrease or increase the intensity of the effect.</p><p>When you choose the Motion Blur, this effect automatically colorizes your picture. You can select the color you want by dragging the hue slider; unclick the box located next to the slider to turn the colorization off completely. Your picture will turn back to the original color.</p><p>What’s more? You can play around with Noise, Angle, and Distance sliders to apply the right amount of motion blur to photos and make sure the sense of movement will go in the right direction.</p><h4 id="Smart-Blur"><a href="#Smart-Blur" class="headerlink" title="Smart Blur"></a>Smart Blur</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-5.png"                      alt="funny blur effects in picsart - smart blur"                ></p><p>Smart Blur gives your photos a luxurious sheen; it blurs out details to make subjects appear less real and a bit more unnaturally perfect. You can consider it a magazine finish.</p><h4 id="Radial-Blur"><a href="#Radial-Blur" class="headerlink" title="Radial Blur"></a>Radial Blur</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-6.png"                      alt="funny blur effects in picsart - Radial Blur"                ></p><p>This blur effect allows you to turn photos into a spinning vortex. It allows you to create a circle of blur effect around a focal point in photos. Every circle has a focal point, and you can move the center of the blur by dragging the crosshairs located in the middle of the blur.</p><p>Objects in your image will bend with the curve of the blur; anything lying in the middle of the circling blur will become a greater point of focus. Move the Blur slider located in the effects settings menu to make your image less or more blurry Zero is the minimum, while 20 is the maximum.</p><p>You can try to apply the Radial Blur effect to automobiles, trains, and planes to intensify their velocity effect.</p><h4 id="Focal-Blur"><a href="#Focal-Blur" class="headerlink" title="Focal Blur"></a>Focal Blur</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-7.png"                      alt="funny blur effects in picsart - Focal Blur"                ></p><p>Focal blur is a radial effect that warps the dimensions of your picture a little for an in-motion look. It’s perfect for images that have subjects in high-speed settings.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Nowadays, the blur effect is a common thing that it’s difficult to believe that it used to be regarded as a sign of flawed photography. Photo blurring became widely acknowledged as legit in the late Nineties, and even an aspirational technique called bokeh, a Japanese term that loosely translates as blur quality.</p><p>● A quick scan of social media imagery shows how popular it has become over the years. You might have been looking in envy at those dreamy and hazy photos asking yourself: How did the photographer manage this? The answer is Picsart.</p><p>● This application has made blurring faces and backgrounds in photos a breeze. That means you can now easily reproduce the blur effect on your photography. The best part is: It is quick and simple to achieve this. Whether you want to hide distracting elements or highlight a figure in the foreground, Picsart can help.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Applying a blur effect on a face using Picsart allows you to change the focus of a photo.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Dynamic-Duality-Balancing-White-and-Black"><a href="#Dynamic-Duality-Balancing-White-and-Black" class="headerlink" title="Dynamic Duality: Balancing White and Black"></a>Dynamic Duality: Balancing White and Black</h2><p>Everyone in the video editing world is full of lively and beautiful colors — just like the world we live in every day. But, if you’ve ever shot any film on a smartphone or a digital camera, you’ve probably observed the colors you see in real life don’t always match up to what you want to see on your screen. In this article, you will grasp how and when to use the color grading process by stylizing the color scheme of your footage and its importance in your everyday film and video projects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-panel-filmora.jpg"                      alt="color grading panel filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Color-Grading"><a href="#What-is-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="What is Color Grading?"></a>What is Color Grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the video editing process wherein grading (arranging) colors in a video or film to give them a stylistic look. It is different from Color correction because color correction is the process of correcting (fixing) colors in a video or a film as a way to get them back to what they should look like for your project or output.</p><p>In cinematography, color grading refers to the manipulation of film and video images to create consistent color tones throughout a motion picture. Many filmmakers use a color palette or preset as part of their overall production plan. These palettes represent artistic choices that provide the film with a cohesive general aspect. When film footage does not adequately match these color palettes, directors and colorists use digital color grading tools to change video colors as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/origianl-video-color-grading.jpg"                      alt="origianl video color grading"                ></p><p>Color grading and color correction are processes that happen throughout postproduction. One makes the film look more native, and the other stylizes the footage. After the colorist finishes color correction, they can begin grading the film. During color grading, colorists use editing software to formalize the footage, highlighting a movie’s visual tone and ambiance and making it look more cinematic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-grading-to-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color grading to video"                ></p><p>To summarize, Color grading can be used to make both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color grading for artistic purposes to ensure that the film’s carefully curated color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Color-Grading-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Color-Grading-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Color Grading Important?"></a>Why is Color Grading Important?</h2><p><strong>Color grading establish a picture’s first impression</strong></p><p>Most images are initially seen as rushed by in one of the infinite scrolls that fill social media or in small thumbnails in galleries. In these circumstances, perfect skin retouching or flawless exposure means very little. Users do not even recognize the image in enough detail with these varieties of an object. Color grading, however, stands out within the condition of these formats. An excellent color-graded image that implores the viewer will drive them to stop and take a closer look. As a photographer, you need support in learning how to grade your ideas so that they will grab viewers’ attention in a fleeting second among the chaotic noise of the digital age.</p><p><strong>It communicates the atmosphere to tune with the scene</strong></p><p>The communication of emotion and story through the lens is one of the most powerful tools a photographer has at their disposal. The grading of a well-graded image can often augment the sense of story within a scene or even completely transform it. Without the grading, an image may look flat, boring, or even disjointed. As a photographer becomes more proficient at grading, he or she can leverage the power of color tone to influence emotional tone within a scene. Grading at this level can transform an unexciting frame into a moment of cinematic magic.</p><p><strong>Color grading encourage a style that can be completely your own</strong></p><p>One of the most intimidating challenges a photographer or vlogger faces is creating a unique style that can result in a brand for their work. Making a visual style that viewers can recognize at a glance can tremendously impact the growth of a photographer’s career. Color grading plays a vital part in that process. Customers will often come to you with a wide range of different photography outputs. By defining a consistent color grading work, you can tie it all into a dense brand that reflects strongly on you and construct a distinctive value that provides you something to sell that only you can offer to people.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Color-Grading-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-use-Color-Grading-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to use Color Grading in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>How to use Color Grading in Wondershare Filmora?</h2><p>There are many color grading software available on your Windows PC or Mac.

Just click the scissor icon or what we call split tool. In this case, I split the 2nd video when I zoom in on the subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/split-video-into-clips-fx.jpg"                      alt="split video into clips fx"                ></p><ul><li>And I selected the end portion of the video.

If satisfied with the result, click the “Export” button to transport your video. Click the Settings button to modify settings if needed. You can save the new videos in different formats under the Format tab. If you want to play the edit file on devices like Tablet, iPad, Kindle Fire, PSP, Xbox, etc., go to the “Devices” tab and select the configured preset for the specific model. You can also upload the video output on Youtube for better preservation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/preview-and-save-video-filmora.jpg"                      alt="preview and save video filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Using the Color Panel Window</strong></p><h5 id="Step1To-perform-color-correction-in-Filmora-switch-to-the-Color-tab"><a href="#Step1To-perform-color-correction-in-Filmora-switch-to-the-Color-tab" class="headerlink" title="Step1To perform color correction in Filmora, switch to the Color tab"></a>Step1To perform color correction in Filmora, switch to the Color tab</h5><p>You can modify the temperature, tint, white balance, contrast, saturation, and brightness and apply 3D LUT directly and quickly in this editing panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-panel-windows-filmora.jpg"                      alt="color panel windows filmora"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Color-grading-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Step2Color-grading-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step2Color grading with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Step2Color grading with Wondershare Filmora</h5><p>Click the button Advanced at the lower corner, then the color grading window will pop up, and you can explore your settings and options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-with-filmora.jpg"                      alt="color grading with filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Color Histogram</strong></p><p>The color histogram informs you of the color condition of this video. This reflects the exact allotment of colors throughout a specific image, highlighting the various colors on the screen and the pixels for every color type. When the color histogram points out as “Three Color Histograms,” a specific assignment of the three primary colors (R, B, and G) is reflected.</p><p><strong>White balance</strong></p><p>You can modify the white balance of this video clip here. This allows you to change how intense each color appears in the video. This is important since white balance enables you to depict images realistically. According to the different intensities of the colors, you can get a much-differentiated outcome in terms of realism.</p><p><strong>Vignette</strong></p><p>It is a French word that initially meant the borders of a book. This process allows the center of the image to appear clear and the edges much fader. In other words, if you wish to focus on the middle of the video and blur the rest, you will need this effect. In this way, you can emphasize what is essential and let the other details disappear into the background.</p><p><strong>Color and light</strong></p><p>In the Color and Light section, you can adjust the Exposure, Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Vibrance, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks.</p><p><strong>3D Look Up Table</strong></p><p>3D LUT is part of the digital middle process. They are mainly used for you to compute how the video will be displayed on various screens and devices. The color space is precisely calculated and mapped to be projected precisely as you would desire. There are, of course, a lot of 3 Dimensional effects allowing you to transform the image of your video as promised.</p><p><strong>HSL</strong></p><p>HSL is the acronym for hue, saturation, and luminosity. It is cylindrical geometry, where you mix the different colors and adjust their intensities to get the accurate mix you are eyeing for in your video. You can select whether you want the video to arise lighter or darker, getting the right mix of colors every time.</p><p>In the HSL section, you can enhance the corresponding color in the video.</p><h5 id="Step3Save-and-export-your-work"><a href="#Step3Save-and-export-your-work" class="headerlink" title="Step3Save and export your work"></a>Step3Save and export your work</h5><p>To view the output, you can compare the video before and after color grading in the A&#x2F;B comparison view. You can eventually save the color grading setting created as a preset and utilize it. If the result is good, click the Export button to upload it to YouTube or Vimeo, Save it as MP4, MKV, WMV, etc., or burn it into DVD.</p><p>Tips: To enter the Advance Color Correction setting, you can select the clip in the timeline and click the Color Tuning icon in the toolbar.</p><p>I hope the mentioned information helps you understand the distinction between Color correction and color grading and creating stunning, excellent videos in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the Color Tuning tools.</p><p>Overall, Color grading is the process of video editing to have an excellent look to help make a video feel more vigorous and stylistic and can define color assessment. Color correcting is the process of editing a video or film to fix any variances in the color so it can display how the viewers are meant to see it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-boost-your-iphone-imagery-with-light-tricks-for-2024/"><u>[New] Boost Your IPhone Imagery With Light Tricks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-correcting-mute-issue-during-obs-recording/"><u>[New] In 2024, Correcting Mute Issue During OBS Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-spotlight-on-professional-shoots-innovative-lighting-techniques/"><u>[New] Spotlight on Professional Shoots Innovative Lighting Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-onestream-playbook-for-live-streamers/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate OneStream Playbook for Live Streamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-workable-fixes-to-the-sim-not-provisioned-mm2-error-on-realme-10t-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Workable Fixes to the SIM not provisioned MM#2 Error on Realme 10T 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-11-best-location-changers-for-vivo-v27-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 11 Best Location Changers for Vivo V27 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-on-your-honor-x50i-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, A Step-by-Step Guide on Using ADB and Fastboot to Remove FRP Lock on your Honor X50i</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-stop-life360-from-tracking-you-on-vivo-v30-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Stop Life360 from Tracking You On Vivo V30? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-team-videography-methods-for-channel-expansion/"><u>In 2024, Team Videography Methods for Channel Expansion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/transformez-votre-photographie-amelioration-et-restauration-dimages-en-haute-resolution-avec-winxvideo-ai/"><u>Transformez Votre Photographie: Amélioration Et Restauration D'Images en Haute Résolution Avec WinxVideo AI</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/your-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-vr-headsets-opt-for-easy-steps-with-mobile-or-connected-devices/"><u>Your Ultimate Guide to Choosing VR Headsets Opt for Easy Steps with Mobile or Connected Devices?</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130530/26400" target="_top" id="2130530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130530/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

They offer a visual guide to creating delicious menu items that range from delicious entrees to kid-friendly snacks.</p><p>If you would like to create some of these food videos yourself, this article will help you shoot the most appealing food videos possible.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="5-Tips-for-Shooting-Food-Videos"><a href="#5-Tips-for-Shooting-Food-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5 Tips for Shooting Food Videos"></a>5 Tips for Shooting Food Videos</h2><h4 id="1-Light"><a href="#1-Light" class="headerlink" title="1. Light"></a>1. Light</h4><p>Light is one of the most crucial factors for your video. If the lighting is too bright, your food videography will appear washed out. If the lighting is too dark, food will appear shadowed and hard to see. Neither is a good option, because it does not present a very professional product.</p><p>The best to use is natural lighting. You want a lot of bright natural light, but not streaming directly through your windows as this creates shadows.</p><p>If the kitchen doesn’t work well for you, experiment with other rooms or outside, but be sure to keep furniture and clutter out of your shots.</p><h4 id="2-Audio"><a href="#2-Audio" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio"></a>2. Audio</h4><p>Audio is one of the main components that sets <a class="link"   href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/visiting-seefood-media-food-videography/" >food videography <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> apart from food photography. There are two viable options. You can either set your video to music, which will help set the tone for your frame speed, or you can use a voice over to provide audible descriptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-audio.JPG"                      alt="audio"                ></p><h4 id="3-Try-to-Tell-a-Story"><a href="#3-Try-to-Tell-a-Story" class="headerlink" title="3. Try to Tell a Story"></a>3. Try to Tell a Story</h4><p>What seems like an insignificant change can be monumental. When crafting recipe videos, you want to try telling a story.</p><p>For example, instead of showing a mixer you could show a mother helping her child to mix the ingredients together. At the end of the clip, you could either show only the food, or you could show a man walking past the window with his dog in tow.</p><p>Telling a story will help to pull watchers into your video so they watch through until the end. It’s all about making viewers as invested as possible in a very short time frame.</p><p>If you don’t start pulling them in, such as by telling a story, in the first twenty seconds, they probably won’t continue watching.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/food-sell-a-story.JPG"                      alt="food"                ></p><h4 id="4-Video-Editing"><a href="#4-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="4. Video Editing"></a>4. Video Editing</h4><p>Once the video is shot, you’ll have to do some post-production work. In other words, you need to edit your video. This is more time consuming than with food photography, because you must edit by frame, place to music, add title frames, and so on.</p><p>One major mistake people make with their food videos is the use of too many transitions or cut-scenes, such as fading, zoom outs, etc.</p><p>The best way to edit your videos is for quality, with a minimum of 90-97% straight shots – meaning no transitions are used.</p><h4 id="5-Decoration"><a href="#5-Decoration" class="headerlink" title="5. Decoration"></a>5. Decoration</h4><p>Some people will choose to shoot their videos using bold, bright colors in their food and setting.</p><p>Others may decide that a simple setting – such as a classic wooden table with nothing more than a small flower vase – is more suitable for the dish they are creating.</p><p>Both are great choices, but the key is to base your settings off your dish, ensuring the area surrounding the food is complementary and not contrasting.</p><p>Videographers may choose to use other techniques to make the final dish pop.</p><p>This could include food carving, plating techniques, or even just the use of high-tech equipment which has the potential to capture even the tiniest food fragment in vivid detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/food-decoration.JPG"                      alt="decoration food"                ></p><h2 id="Equipment"><a href="#Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Equipment"></a>Equipment</h2><h4 id="1-Smart-Phone"><a href="#1-Smart-Phone" class="headerlink" title="1. Smart Phone"></a>1. Smart Phone</h4><p>One way to shoot food videos is with your smart phone. To do this, use the built-in camera feature set to take video in landscape mode (this looks the best).</p><p>Hold very still to prevent shaking, and simply hold the screen for autofocus and exposure prior to beginning your film.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-7-plus-4k-smartphone.jpg"                      alt="smart phone"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lens"><a href="#2-Lens" class="headerlink" title="2. Lens"></a>2. Lens</h4><p>If you are going to shoot with a camera, you need either a mirrorless camera or DSLR. A standard click-and-shoot will not provide a high enough quality of video. Along with a high-quality camera comes the need for a high-quality lens.</p><p>The lens you shoot with should be able to zoom in or out on the food. You’ll want to avoid a lens that presents static, or has any nicks, chips, or cuts in the glass.</p><p>As for the shooting itself, you can feel free to experiment with lenses that offer unique styles, such as soft or hard</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fujinon-mk18-55mm-t2.9-lens.jpg"                      alt="lens"                ></p><h4 id="3-Tripod"><a href="#3-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Lighting-Setup-Tips-to-Make-Great-Videos"><a href="#Lighting-Setup-Tips-to-Make-Great-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Lighting Setup Tips to Make Great Videos"></a>Lighting Setup Tips to Make Great Videos</h2><p>Many people are wondering how to set up lighting for video shooting. While there are many different ways to set up lighting, some methods are more effective than others.</p><p>Therefore, this article will give you a complete guide on how to set up your lighting to make your videos stand out.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Guide"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How-to Guide"></a>Part 1. How-to Guide</h2><p><strong><em>1) Preparation</em></strong></p><p>Before we get started, you may need to prepare some things to set up your lighting:</p><p><strong>1. Powerful LED Lights</strong></p><p>LED lights are a huge step up from traditional incandescent lighting because they generate much less heat and energy. Also, you can change the color temperature and use different lighting effects.</p><p><strong>2. Softbox</strong></p><p>Softbox can help you diffuse and spread the light on the subject.</p><p><strong>3. Fresnel lens</strong></p><p>A Fresnel lens is an optional attachment that can bounce the light off of the ceiling of your studio and diffuses the light to look soft.</p><p><strong><em>2) Steps</em></strong></p><p>For this tutorial, we will use the Three-Point Lighting technique:</p><h5 id="Step1-Set-the-Key-Light"><a href="#Step1-Set-the-Key-Light" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Set the Key Light"></a>Step1 Set the Key Light</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-1.jpg"                      alt="set the key light"                ></p><p>The key light is the main light that illuminates the subject. You can place it in the front and slightly to one side. For this key light, we use an LED called Aputure 300X as an example, and with a soft box called light Dome 2.</p><h5 id="Step2-Set-the-Fill-Light"><a href="#Step2-Set-the-Fill-Light" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Set the Fill Light"></a>Step2 Set the Fill Light</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-2.jpg"                      alt="set the fill light"                ></p><p>The fill light is used to fill in the shadows created by the key light. It is usually placed on the opposite side of the subject. For the fill light, we use an Aputure 300D with a fresnel lens attachment.</p><h5 id="Step3-Set-the-Backlight"><a href="#Step3-Set-the-Backlight" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Set the Backlight"></a>Step3 Set the Backlight</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-3.jpg"                      alt="set the backlight"                ></p><p>For this tutorial, we use Aperture 120d as the backlight and lift it up into the air with a c-stand so it can light the subject from above. It helps to separate the talent from the background and give the audience a full view of the set</p><h5 id="Step4-Use-Practical-Lights"><a href="#Step4-Use-Practical-Lights" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Use Practical Lights"></a>Step4 Use Practical Lights</h5><p>Practical lights appear on the camera to add some visual flair. It can be any light source that isn’t meant for lighting the subject. For example, we use a green lamp to help our background pop as it casts a nice orange light on the back wall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-4.jpg"                      alt="use practical lights"                ></p><p>Then, we also have a LED ring light that shines toward the camera. The light adds even more light to the frame and gives a slight backlight to the subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-5.jpg"                      alt="led ring light"                ></p><p>Finally, we have a few other small LED lights like this unicorn to put in the background. This lighting helps us to get even more visual flair out of our shots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-6.jpg"                      alt="other small led lights"                ></p><p>After setting up all the lighting above, you can take a look at the comparison below:</p><p><strong>Using Key Light only</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-7.jpg"                      alt="using key light only"                ></p><p><strong>Using Key Light + Fill + Backlight</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-8.jpg"                      alt="using key light + fill + backlight"                ></p><p><strong><em>3) Pro Tips: The light setting</em></strong></p><p>We usually set the lights around 50% brightness and a color temperature of 5600K.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-9.jpg"                      alt="the light setting"                ></p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, you learned something about lighting by taking a look at our setup.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Elevating-Your-iPhone-Photos-Through-HDR-Methods"><a href="#Elevating-Your-iPhone-Photos-Through-HDR-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Elevating Your iPhone Photos Through HDR Methods"></a>Elevating Your iPhone Photos Through HDR Methods</h2><p>Are you annoyed that your iPhone camera is unable to capture what your eyes see? Well, no need to waste your energy. The iPhone camera offers just the perfect feature to counter this problem - the HDR feature.</p><p>Most people have to use photo editing software to fix the exposures of photos, but luckily for us, we don’t need that.</p><p>In this article, we will give you a brief overview of HDR photography and then guide you on how to shoot HDR photos with an iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?"></a>Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?</h2><p>HDR is short for High Dynamic Range, and it refers to a photography technique where multiple exposures of a scene are combined to create one well-lit picture. It captures a scene’s darkest and lightest tone and shows them as such in the final photo.</p><p>Apple introduced the HDR feature back in 2010 on iPhone 4. It was a breakthrough for the company, further enhancing the iPhone camera. Since then, all the succeeding models of the iPhone have the HDR feature.</p><p>However, Apple has advanced its HDR technology with the passage of time. Before the release of the iPhone 12, Apple worked with HDR10. With the iPhone 12, Apple inculcated Dolby Vision HDR, becoming the first to roll out Dolby Vision in a mobile handset.</p><p>Without the HDR feature, your iPhone camera is not capable of capturing a high-contrast scene.

This happens when the “Keep Normal Photo” setting is enabled in the iPhone Camera Settings. This setting is only available on iPhone X and earlier.</p><p>For the latest versions, you can only see the Smart HDR option. By default, Smart HDR does not save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><p>The “Keep Normal Photo” option is helpful in instances where you might have to compare the HDR and non-HDR versions. You may even prefer the non-HDR version in some cases.</p><p>But the side effect of this feature is that it becomes a nuisance to delete the other versions, and it also takes up space.</p><p>Here is how you can disable this setting and avoid having two same photos.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings-1"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>Go to your iPhone Settings and tap on the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option"><a href="#Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option" class="headerlink" title="Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option"></a>Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option</h5><p>You will see a “Keep Normal Photo” toggle in the HDR panel.

Apple introduced a “Smart HDR” option on iPhone where the camera shoots photos in HDR (when necessary) by default. This option ensures that users don’t have to go to great lengths to get amazing shots.</p><p>However, there may be instances when you feel that the “Smart HDR” option is not working.</p><h3 id="Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App"></a><strong>Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App</strong></h3><p>There may be a case where you open your Camera app to take a picture in HDR but there is no HDR option available to you. This is usually the case with iPhone 13 models, and its pro variants.</p><p>Well, the reason behind it is that Apple has added a new feature in these models that the Camera is set to capture HDR shots by default. So, users do not have the option to control the HDR feature.</p><p>It certainly takes away the control that users had in their shots because not all HDR images turn out to be perfect. Especially while zooming into things, the images start looking like a painting. However, it works just fine in most cases.</p><h3 id="Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max"><a href="#Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max"></a><strong>Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max</strong></h3><p>Certain iPhone XS Max users are facing a problem where the Photos app does not show whether the image is an HDR image or not. Previously, users could see an “HDR” tag on their photos. However, recently the tags are not visible anymore.</p><p>Worry not, this does not mean that your Smart HDR is not working. You can check this by disabling Smart HDR from Settings &gt; Camera. Once Smart HDR is disabled, go to the Camera app and take a picture without HDR. Compare the before and after images to see if your HDR feature is working or not.</p><p>Such instances of Smart HDR may occur but you don’t need to worry too much about them. The simple solutions mentioned above will surely fix your problem. In case they don’t help, you can contact the Apple Support to get your queries resolved.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device"><a href="#Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device"></a>Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device</h2><p>HDR photography is a really cool technique that can really make your content more appealing.
