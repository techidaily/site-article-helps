The Sony FDRA53&#x2F;B 4K camcorder is by no means an exception. The camcorder is equipped with Sony’s state of the art image stabilization technology that helps you create crystal clear footage even when the camera is shaking. This 4K camcorder is light and easy to use, but many of its options are automatic, which prevents the user from controlling all the parameters during the recording session.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01950TCEU/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01950TCEU&linkId=e935032c98c66b35920d601b25a0bb11" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h4 id="2-Sony-FDR-AX33-4K"><a href="#2-Sony-FDR-AX33-4K" class="headerlink" title="2.

Optical zoom can go as high as 20X in both HD and 4K modes, while the Clear Image Zoom feature can provide an additional artificial zoom boost to 30X zoom for 4K and 40X zoom for HD. The Sony FDR-AX33 4K camcorder is an excellent and above all affordable choice for average users who are not in need of the high-end professional equipment.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R5LH9G0/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00R5LH9G0&linkId=bccccf2ac73c9a6b193fdbc1bdd39ae9" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h4 id="3-Sony-FDR-AX100-B-4K"><a href="#3-Sony-FDR-AX100-B-4K" class="headerlink" title="3.

The Sony FDR-AX100&#x2F;B is capable of producing resolutions four times higher than Full HD, it can capture video in 4K Ultra HD at 24fps or 30fps and it can also create still frames that are as large as 20MB. The users can choose between XAVC S, AVCHD or MP4 file formats, but some of these formats demand special SD cards that can support them.

Although the camcorder features a G lens with 20X optical zoom, the lens isn’t interchangeable. The Sony PXW-Z100 4K is capable of recording true 4K 4096x2160 resolution videos at up to 50 and 60fps. It utilizes Sony’s XVAC 4:2:2 recording format, which means that converting the footage into a video format that can be easily played or distributed through the Internet can take a significant amount of time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IDV0KKS/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00IDV0KKS&linkId=0c2609a0a54e30d1a8251493875c6b6d" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h4 id="5-Sony-PXW-Z150-4K"><a href="#5-Sony-PXW-Z150-4K" class="headerlink" title="5.

Easy to take with"></a>1. Easy to take with</h4><p>Most camcorders available on the market today are easy to carry around, so when buying a 4K camcorder you should think about how easy the model you are planning on buying is to carry around. Also, keep in mind that lightweight cameras are more difficult to hold still.</p><h4 id="2-Wide-lens-and-large-sensors"><a href="#2-Wide-lens-and-large-sensors" class="headerlink" title="2. Wide lens and large sensors"></a>2. Wide lens and large sensors</h4><p>The sensor of a camera is perhaps its most important part. The 1-inch sensor pretty much enables you to record video in any light conditions. Most of the 4K camcorders have integrated wide angle lenses, but it is important to find out what the lens on your camcorder can and cannot do.</p><h4 id="3-Built-in-viewfinder"><a href="#3-Built-in-viewfinder" class="headerlink" title="3. Built-in viewfinder"></a>3. Built-in viewfinder</h4><p>As great as camera displays are, they are not always reliable and you can’t always be sure that the images you are seeing on the display are going to look like that once you transfer them onto your hard drive. A good viewfinder can help you to make sure that your videos are not overexposed or underexposed and that your footage is always in focus.</p><h4 id="4-Optical-Zoom"><a href="#4-Optical-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="4. Optical Zoom"></a>4. Optical Zoom</h4><p>Using a camera often means that you want to record something that is not near you. Sometimes you might want to film only a detail, but without a proper lens, this task is impossible. 4K camcorders do not have interchangeable lenses which is why an optical zoom can be crucial in situations when you want to record something that is out of your reach. Most 4K camcorders also have a digital zoom, but digital zoom reduces the picture quality and it is best to avoid using it.</p><h4 id="5-Image-stabilization"><a href="#5-Image-stabilization" class="headerlink" title="5. Image stabilization"></a>5. Image stabilization</h4><p>Capturing motion isn’t as easy as it sounds. Moving objects tend to create a blur, which is why Image stabilization techniques are such an important factor that determines the quality of any camera. Camera shake can result in unusable footage and if you are looking to buy a 4K camcorder make sure that the camera you wish to purchase has a superb Image stabilization.</p><h4 id="6-External-Microphone-Jack"><a href="#6-External-Microphone-Jack" class="headerlink" title="6. External Microphone Jack"></a>6. External Microphone Jack</h4><p>Internal camera sound is often too terrible to be used in the post-production. If you’d like to record professional sound for your videos make sure that the 4K camcorder has at least one XLR jack.</p><h4 id="7-Night-Vision"><a href="#7-Night-Vision" class="headerlink" title="7.

It is a video-sharing platform where people share videos doing different activities. Due to the rise of cyberbullying, racism, and other harmful activities, concerns have been raised for minors using TikTok. In a bid to counter it, TikTok has banned kids under 13 from using the app.</p><p>The accounts of teens from 13 to 16 have been made private to minimize the negative effects. If you, by mistake, have entered the wrong birthdate when setting up your account, you can learn <strong>how to change your age on TikTok</strong> from this article.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="change age on tiktok featured image"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Change-Your-Age-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Change-Your-Age-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Change Your Age on TikTok"></a>Part 1: How to Change Your Age on TikTok</h2><p>The 13-year age restriction on TikTok is not only to protect minors from the harmful side of the internet. It is to comply with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States. To ensure that users don’t cheat with age-requirement, TikTok has removed the option to edit the birthdate from the app.</p><p>It has also made all the accounts of those under 16 privates. If your account has been age-restricted by mistake, below are two possible methods on <strong>how</strong> <strong>to edit age on TikTok</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135412/19272" target="_top" id="2135412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135412/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Way-1-Contact-TikTok-Support-Team-to-Change-Your-Age-Recommended"><a href="#Way-1-Contact-TikTok-Support-Team-to-Change-Your-Age-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Way 1: Contact TikTok Support Team to Change Your Age (Recommended)"></a>Way 1: Contact TikTok Support Team to Change Your Age (Recommended)</h3><p>Since TikTok has removed the feature to edit your birthdate from its app, you will need to contact their support team to change your age. You can contact support through the app if your account is still working. Otherwise, you will need to contact them through email. Below are the steps to contact support for changing your age through the TikTok app on your smartphone:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your TikTok app and tap on “Profile” from the bottom right corner. Next, touch on “Three Lines” from the top right corner of the profile screen and access “Settings and Privacy.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="select settings and privacy"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027162/19272" target="_top" id="2027162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027162/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now navigate to the “Support &amp; About” section and tap “Report a Problem.” Press “Account and Profile” on the next screen and tap “Editing Profile.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="select report a problem option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137380/7443" target="_top" id="2137380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137380/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Here, choose “Other,” and on the next window, press “Need More Help?” It will open a feedback form where you can mention your problem and request the support team to solve it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-4.jpg"                      alt="tap on need more help"                ></p><h3 id="Way-2-Create-a-New-TikTok-Account-to-Change-Your-Age-Not-Recommended"><a href="#Way-2-Create-a-New-TikTok-Account-to-Change-Your-Age-Not-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Way 2: Create a New TikTok Account to Change Your Age (Not-Recommended)"></a>Way 2: Create a New TikTok Account to Change Your Age (Not-Recommended)</h3><p>If your TikTok account has been placed under age restriction, you can create a new TikTok account with the correct age. However, it is not the recommended method, as you will lose all of your old account data and followers.</p><p>If you are underage, you should not try to create a new account with a false age. Lying about your age can result in legal difficulties for you if caught. You can create a new TikTok account on your smartphone using TikTok app through these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install the TikTok app through Google Play Store or App Store and open it. Agree to their terms and services and tap “Profile” from the bottom right corner to navigate to the signup page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-5.jpg"                      alt="access the profile tab"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you choose “Email or Phone,” you will need to provide your “Email” or “Phone” on the next screen. You will need to go through a verification CAPTCHA and, on the next screen, create a password for your account. Provide your correct birthdate and press “Next” to complete the account creation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-6.jpg"                      alt="confirm your birthdate"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can also use your Google, Facebook, Apple, or Twitter account to create your TikTok account. Pressing any of these will take you to the respective app for login verification. Provide the confirmation, and your TikTok account will be created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-7.jpg"                      alt="select social media to sign up"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134498/18498" target="_top" id="2134498">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134498" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134498/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-TikTok-Video-Editor-–-Filmora-for-Mobile"><a href="#Part-2-TikTok-Video-Editor-–-Filmora-for-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: TikTok Video Editor – Filmora for Mobile"></a>Part 2: TikTok Video Editor – Filmora for Mobile</h2><p>Are you an avid TikTok user who likes creating fun and stunning videos to share with your followers?

The software’s list of watermarking features includes options like Signature, Arc Text, StegoMark or Metadata that enable you to add visible and invisible watermarks to your photos and videos. iWatermark also offers batch processing feature so that you can simultaneously add watermarks with the exact same settings to multiple images.</p><h4 id="2-uMark"><a href="#2-uMark" class="headerlink" title="2. uMark"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.uconomix.com/Products/uMark/" >uMark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, $29 for a full version of the software</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS</p><p>There are different options of the software available, so you can opt for uMark Photo Watermarker if you’re only working with photos or you can use uMark Video Watermarker in case you often upload videos to the Internet. The app lets you use both text and images as watermarks on your photos, and it also offers powerful batch processing options that automate the process of watermarking large amounts of images. In addition to conventional watermarking options, uMark also lets you watermark your photos with QR codes or different shapes.

You can choose the font, the size of the text or adjust the opacity of each watermark you create with Arclab Watermark Studio and even use logos as watermarks. The option to add multiple watermarks to a single image is also available as well as the batch processing feature that lets you apply the same watermark to an unlimited number of pictures. The Arclab Watermark Studio is equipped with image resizing tools which makes it a perfect choice for photographers who often post their work on social media.</p><h4 id="4-TSR-Watermark-Image"><a href="#4-TSR-Watermark-Image" class="headerlink" title="4. TSR Watermark Image"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.watermark-image.com/" >TSR Watermark Image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $29.95</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Professional photographers who have previous experience with photo editing software, won’t need too much time to get used to TSR Watermark Image. Besides the basic text and image watermarking options, the software also offers the 3D watermark feature. The images that were taken with Canon, Sony, Nikon, and numerous other cameras can also be watermarked through metadata. The TSR Watermark Image app provides a rich selection of special effects, borders, and crosses that let you create stylish watermarks. The free version of this photo watermarking software offers only a limited amount of options and if you want to gain access to more than 200 fonts or advanced uploading features you must purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p><h4 id="5-Mass-Watermark"><a href="#5-Mass-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="5. Mass Watermark"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.masswatermark.com/" >Mass Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $30 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>As its name suggests, Mass Watermark is designed to make the process of watermarking large quantities of photos quick and simple. In addition to powerful batch processing features this watermarking software for Mac and PC computers is equipped with Image Optimization tools that let you improve the overall quality of your photos before you apply a watermark to them. The app’s Watermark Designer lets you customize each watermark you create, while the Crop, Rotate and Resize features enable you to optimize your pictures for online use. What’s more, you can upload your photos to Flickr or your Picasa Web Album directly from Mass Watermark.</p><h4 id="6-Watermark-Software"><a href="#6-Watermark-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. Watermark Software"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://www.watermark-software.com/" >Watermark Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $24.90 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>The fact that you can watermark up to 300 photos in just one minute with this photo watermarking software speaks volumes about its capabilities. In fact, you can watermark all your photos with Watermark Software in just three easy steps, since you just have to import the images to which you want to add a watermark, insert text or picture you’d like to use as a watermark and wait for the app to process them. The Watermark Tiling feature makes unauthorized usage of your work even more difficult, while the EXIF editor enables you to add watermarks to a photo’s metadata. The free version of the app offers only a limited number of features, and you must purchase the lifetime license if want to use all the watermarking tools this app has to offer.</p><h4 id="7-Alamoon-Watermark"><a href="#7-Alamoon-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="7. Alamoon Watermark"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://alamoon.com/watermark-editor.html" >Alamoon Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>Despite being slightly outdated, Alamoon Watermark software is still a reliable option for all photographers who are looking for a simple way to add watermarks to their photos. This editor supports a broad range of photo file formats and it is capable of processing thousands of images in just a couple of minutes. However, it lacks advanced watermarking and photo editing tools, so enhancing the colors in a photo or creating watermark templates is not possible with Alamoon Watermark app. The professional version of this watermarking software is largely overpriced and there are more powerful and more affordable options available.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Watermark"><a href="#8-Star-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="8. Star Watermark"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://www.star-watermark.com/" >Star Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, pricing plans start at $17 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>Customizing each watermark you create with this cross-platform app is a straightforward process that won’t take more than a few minutes of your time. You can easily alter the size of the text, change its color, add shadows or position the text anywhere in the photo. Star Watermark enables its users to use images as watermarks or even create multilayered watermarks. The batch processing features, however, remain one of the most common reasons why professional photographers opt to use the Star Watermark software. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t offer any of the advanced watermarking features, and it doesn’t allow you to use your digital signature as a watermark.</p><h4 id="9-Visual-Watermark"><a href="#9-Visual-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="9. Visual Watermark"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="https://www.visualwatermark.com/" >Visual Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing plans start at $19.95 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Android</p><p>The Visual Watermark software makes watermarking hundreds of photos in a short period of time look easy. Besides watermarking photos, you can also use the Visual Watermark application to add watermarks to videos. There are 260 fonts available, but you can also import your own custom-made fonts and use them to create watermarks. The software adjusts the size and the position of the watermark to each photo automatically, but you can also fine-tune each of these settings manually. Most importantly, the Visual Watermark software protects your images from artificial intelligence algorithms that remove watermarks from photos automatically by making minor changes to the template you’re applying to the photos you’re processing.</p><h4 id="10-Water-Marquee"><a href="#10-Water-Marquee" class="headerlink" title="10. Water Marquee"></a>10. <a class="link"   href="https://www.watermarquee.com/" >Water Marquee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Web-based</p><p>This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images. The process of adding a watermark to a photo with Water Marquee is remarkably simple, as you just have to upload a photo to the platform and click on the Add Text, Add Logo or Use Template option. You can then proceed to insert the text, select its size, color or font and decide if you want to use a solid or transparent background. When done, simply click on the Save icon and choose the destination folder on your hard drive in which the watermarked photo is going to be stored.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There is no way to control what happens to the photos you share on your website or on your social media accounts because people can share, repost or download them with a single click. The best way to reduce the chances of unsanctioned use of your work is to watermark all the pictures you share online. Which photo watermarking software do you use to copyright your photos?

Select your image and click <strong>“Open”</strong> to import your picture.</p><p>From the right-side panel, open the <strong>Layers</strong> tab and click the <strong>“Lock”</strong> icon to unlock your image layer, which is set as locked by default. Now, right-click on the layer and select <strong>“Rasterize &amp; Trim.”</strong> Rasterization will help remove the background.</p><p>Step2 Next, you have to make a selection around your object&#x2F;subject in the picture. Click the <strong>“Selection Brush”</strong> tool from the left-side panel to do so.</p><p>Now your cursor will be changed to a circle. To increase or decrease the brush size, use the <strong>Right</strong> and <strong>Left Bracket</strong> keys on your keyboard. Now, move around the brush on your image to outline your subject.</p><p>Step3 Once you’ve made a selection around your object, it’s time to refine it to make it more precise. To do so, click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option from the top toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu.</p><p>Focus on the <strong>Foreground</strong> and <strong>Background</strong> brushes in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu and toggle between these settings to make your selection more accurate. You can use the <strong>Right or Left Bracket</strong> key on your keyboard to adjust the brush size where needed.<br>Once satisfied with your changes, click the <strong>“Apply”</strong> option in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu to save your settings.</p><p>Step4 Now that you’ve outlined your subject clearly and precisely, it’s time to remove the busy background. To do so, click the <strong>Delete key</strong> on your keyboard if you use a Windows PC.</p><p>If you are using a Mac system, click <strong>“Edit”</strong> in the toolbar and select <strong>“Cut”</strong> from the drop-down menu.

Both of these software offer unique media management services but when it comes to professional level real time applications then careful selection becomes essential. The article below can help you to make detailed comparison between VLC and MPC; probably you will soon be able to decide the right solution for your needs.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC"><a href="#Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of VLC and MPC"></a>Comparison of VLC and MPC</h2><h3 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h3><p>There are very limited things to talk about user interfaces of both these software; they are quite simple. The design for MPC-HC is actually derived from its predecessor Media Player Classic and it originally follows the design track of Windows XP&#x2F;95 Media player. On the other side, VLC offers quite clunky icons with deep orange color that most of the time appear irritating to eyes.</p><p>The real difference lies between their features and menus where MPC-HC offers much organized service. It keeps all things at right place for both full screen and small screen modes whereas in case of VLC, users often need to organise a search for their desired content. MPC-HC retains its size even when video loops are formed but VLC immediately holds back the control to whole screen whenever playbacks start.</p><h3 id="Video-Support"><a href="#Video-Support" class="headerlink" title="Video Support"></a>Video Support</h3><p>When video files were tested on both these platforms, MPC-HC provides decent results. Even the 4K content was displayed well on MPC-HC but VLC caused little loss for frames while missing the smoothness in between.</p><p>MPC performed better for almost all media file tests but its performance decayed little bit with old MPEG-1 file format. However, both these players found difficulties for seeking track over WMV files but VLC somehow managed the longer jumps. When tests were performed for DVD and VCDs then both players performed better while handling all menus and elements with ease. Performance for non-protected type Blu-ray files was also significant in both cases.</p><p>The sad thing about VLC is that when it finds some problem for playing any media file then it often goes into infinite loops and they can be finally broken only with task manager. But in case of MPC-HC, when some files appear un supported to this platform it simply says no to it.</p><h3 id="Audio-Support"><a href="#Audio-Support" class="headerlink" title="Audio Support"></a>Audio Support</h3><p>MPC-HC as well as VLC, both these file formats supported WAV files perfectly up to 96KHz up to 32 bits. It also extends great support to standard compressed media file formats like APE&lt; FLAC, M4A, MP3 and Opus. You cannot play .VQF files on both these platforms.</p><p>VLC also finds trouble with Windows lossless files but MPC-HC can handle them well along with Apple Lossless content. In case of CD based playbacks, both these players worked well whereas performance of VLC was much smoother for track switching needs.</p><h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>For most of the subtitle tests, MPC-HC performed with acceptable quality but in case of VLC you have to drag subtitle file on top of the movie so that it can play it in synchronism.

But MPC-HC reported sudden failure for JPEG content; however it was later displayed well.

MPC-HC further offers more advanced controls like interactive magnification etc that you may find behind dialogue boxes.</p><p>It is also possible to use advanced filters in case of MPC-HC, the range includes emboss, edge sharpen and gray scale options.

The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity.

So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines.

Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process.

Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish.

You can grab your headphones and tune in to your favorite podcast episode, making doing laundry an information-filled session and more effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-8.jpg"                      alt="laundry podcast"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130870/7443" target="_top" id="2130870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Better yet, swift to hand-laundering. Hand laundering has a bad rep, but it is one of the best ways to burn some calories.

Not only can you listen to your podcasts, but if you choose the right one, you will cry and laugh as you walk the dog.</p><p>Besides, podcasts are one of the most followed things by dog-loving communities. A lot of people have the habit of tuning in to their favorite podcasts while walking their dogs, and you can be one of them.</p><h3 id="10-Do-the-Dishes"><a href="#10-Do-the-Dishes" class="headerlink" title="10.

Microsoft Teams, a platform for corporate collaboration, is part of the Microsoft 365 family of products. Teams provides file storage, application integration, workplace chat, and videoconferencing. Microsoft’s existing workplace communications and collaboration solutions, notably Skype for Business and Microsoft Classroom, will be replaced by Teams. With that in mind, we’ve compiled this guide to explain How to Zoom in Teams among the other features that would be helpful as a Team user.</p><p>Through Teams, users may talk with one another. Users do not need to check a discussion history since conversations on Teams are permanent, in contrast to Skype for Business. In conversations, users may format text and include emoticons. The user may designate a communication as urgent or important. Communications regarded as important have a red symbol. Along with real-time communications, Teams users may collaborate on documents. Microsoft has a considerable competitive edge over competitors as you can learn How to Zoom out in Microsoft Teams. Follow the guide below to learn how to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="zoom microsoft teams"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Way-to-Zoom-in-Teams"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Way-to-Zoom-in-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Way to Zoom in Teams"></a>Part 1: Best Way to Zoom in Teams</h2><p>By visiting a certain online address or receiving an invitation from the team administrator, communities, organizations, or teams may join Teams.

The webcam or any other camera that is linked to the computer may be accessed by this program, which is highly powerful.

And one of the reasons for this is that they are skilled at creating titles for YouTube videos that attract viewers. Discover the best strategies for producing and disseminating content that attracts consumers. But there’s no denying that, when used properly, clickbait titles are effective at attracting users’ attention and encouraging clicks. Even while there isn’t a set length requirement for YouTube video titles, using these pointers can help you come up with a catchy, keyword-rich title.</p><ul><li>Be innovative and come up with something no one else is doing right now if you want to attract attention with your video title.</li><li>By doing some keyword research, you can find out what people are searching for on Google and YouTube, and then utilize one of those terms or phrases to create a title.</li><li>Using a narrative strategy might make you stand out from the competition since people are attracted to tales.</li><li>Include the most important information at the beginning of your title since lengthier titles are more likely to get chopped off in search page results.</li><li>By being detailed, you provide the reader information they may use to decide if your movie is what they are searching for. By doing this, you could appear higher in search results.</li><li>People also like information that has numbers and lists. Numbers in titles increase the likelihood that they will be clicked on.</li></ul><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Clickbait headlines are often sensationalistic, deceptive, or downright absurd. We must keep in mind that your audience will see the headline before reading the material as a whole. However, if your headlines are uninteresting, your viewers won’t click on them to read the material you have prepared for them. That’s why you need a clickbait video title generator. Pick your favorite from the above-mentioned ones and let us know if you find out the purpose of your primary title that was to capture the attention of your readers and persuade them to click your link.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-accelerate-document-creation-learning-ms-words-speech-feature/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Accelerate Document Creation Learning MS Word's Speech Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-calculating-total-vids-for-high-capacity-hardware-64128gb/"><u>[New] In 2024, Calculating Total Vids for High-Capacity Hardware (64/128GB)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-zenith-workspace-in-depth-studio-overview-2023-edition/"><u>[New] In 2024, Zenith Workspace In-Depth Studio Overview, 2023 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-maximize-your-screen-recording-experience-with-w8-tools/"><u>[New] Maximize Your Screen Recording Experience with W8 Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-effortless-large-file-sharing-iphone-to-mac-streamlined-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Effortless Large File Sharing IPhone to Mac Streamlined Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-professional-guidelines-for-text-overlays-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Professional Guidelines for Text Overlays (Vimeo)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-step-by-step-android-guide-to-enjoy-virtual-reality/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Android Guide to Enjoy Virtual Reality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-essential-8-websites-fusing-impressive-3d-and-opulent-texts/"><u>[Updated] Essential 8 Websites Fusing Impressive 3D & Opulent Texts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-impart-rotational-luminosity-modification-in-photoshopping-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Impart Rotational Luminosity Modification in Photoshopping for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-essential-game-streamers-for-your-watchlist/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential Game Streamers for Your Watchlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-guide-to-using-eraser-tool-in-photoshop/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Guide to Using Eraser Tool In Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-proficient-approaches-for-tiktok-bios-with-linked-content/"><u>[Updated] Proficient Approaches for TikTok Bios with Linked Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/get-the-latest-logitech-rx250-drivers-here-for-windows-users-on-os-7810/"><u>Get the Latest Logitech RX250 Drivers Here for Windows Users on OS 7/8/10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/innovative-practices-in-creating-powerful-youtube-summaries-for-2024/"><u>Innovative Practices in Creating Powerful YouTube Summaries for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/restore-inkjet-connectivity-for-windows-vistaxp-users/"><u>Restore Inkjet Connectivity for Windows Vista/XP Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/unlock-apple-iphone-12-mini-without-passcode-easily-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Unlock Apple iPhone 12 mini Without Passcode Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-significance-deciphering-the-act-of-tagging-others/"><u>Unveiling the Significance: Deciphering the Act of Tagging Others</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The computer followed by computer graphics have revolutionized the way in which engineers now design and manufacture products, and virtual reality engineering now has the potential to revolutionize further the engineering design cycle by giving engineers a new vision into the computer world. Up until only very recently, virtual reality was the exclusive domain of some select university researchers.</p><p> But now with the appearance of commercially available virtual reality software and peripherals, companies are capable and have now started building different virtual reality applications to solve some real engineering problems.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Virtual-Reality-in-Car-Manufacturing"><a href="#Virtual-Reality-in-Car-Manufacturing" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Reality in Car Manufacturing"></a>Virtual Reality in Car Manufacturing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vr-in-car.jpg"                      alt="vr-in-car"                ></p><p> The auto industry presently at the cusp of its latest transformation, being a leader in the adoption of virtual reality engineering in every process of the manufacturing, marketing, and sales, right from the design of new products to the industry’s marketing.</p><p> With the VR technology, however, the automotive manufacturers can speed up the development of new models from the concept phase to the final design more efficiently than ever before. It is said that Audi, Ford, Ferrari, Toyota, and Volvo are jumping on the VR bandwagon. Moreover, the vehicle shoppers can use VR to virtually test drive different vehicle models in the auto dealerships or at their own home.</p><h2 id="Virtual-Reality-in-Aircraft"><a href="#Virtual-Reality-in-Aircraft" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Reality in Aircraft"></a>Virtual Reality in Aircraft</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vr-in-aircraft-manufacturing.jpg"                      alt="vr-in-aircraft-manufacturing"                ></p><p> In addition to training, which has been one of the pioneering uses of virtual reality in aviation by way of simulators, aviation can also make use of virtual reality for other important functions like marketing and for creating a superior in-flight experience for the fliers. For in-flight entertainment, a combination of VR-headset and earbuds can transform any of the newer models of a smartphone into a wireless private theatre or a virtual reality experience. Pilot performance is evaluated in a flight simulator instead of an actual aircraft, which is also true for pilots who are changing the types of aircrafts they fly. This helps save lots of money.</p><p> Operating a real aircraft for even an hour will be significantly more expensive than operating on the simulator of a similar plane. Besides, this allows the fleet to continue with its routine operations as no aircrafts are used for training purposes. Moreover, there is the very important aspect of safety. Virtual reality training on simulators allows the pilots to do and train for a lot of very critical things in the simulator. It enables them to be prepared for unforeseen situations like smoke in the cabin, engine failures, wheels up landing, ditching, etc. It might be almost impossible to train for these sort of stuff in a real aircraft. Virtual reality is also used by almost all aircraft manufacturers. They prepare a simulation that will replicate the experience they expect in their freshly designed aircrafts and have the test pilots in it and test it for various real life situations in an airplane. This allows the pilots to look out for some of the design flaws and ask for correction even before the first flight. What’s more, the pilots can practice in the simulated environment before actually flying, cutting down the costs significantly.</p><h2 id="Virtual-Reality-in-Construction"><a href="#Virtual-Reality-in-Construction" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Reality in Construction"></a>Virtual Reality in Construction</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vr-in-construction.jpg"                      alt="vr-in-construction"                ></p><p> Of the many new technologies that are expected to impact the building sector in the near future, virtual reality engineering as a concept is one of the most important areas which may likely have a significant effect over the near term. Across all the sectors, the volume of investment that is being absorbed by this technology is huge. The construction business is not really going to miss out on this.</p><p> A recent survey conducted among the various leaders in this field, viz. the architecture, construction, virtual reality engineering by ARC Document Solutions Inc., a leading document and information management services provider for the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, found that 65.3 per cent of the respondents thought that virtual reality would be used much more going forward in design and construction practice. Survey participants indicated that the virtual reality technologies make the projects very easy to visualize.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Virtual-Reality-in-Appliance-Manufacturers"><a href="#Virtual-Reality-in-Appliance-Manufacturers" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Reality in Appliance Manufacturers"></a>Virtual Reality in Appliance Manufacturers</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vr-in-appliance-manufacturers.jpg"                      alt="vr-in-appliance-manufacturers"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925489/19272" target="_top" id="1925489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925489/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Virtual Reality can be very effective when planning on the electrical appliances.

But, in some situations, the fisheye look is really a strong disturbance for images&#x2F;videos as the straight lines become bent and from central location frames gets oversized. No matter whether you are shooting videos or working with photos, it is possible to remove fisheye distortion. The article below will provide you complete detail about the process of removing fisheye distortion.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Remove-Fisheye-from-GoPro-Footage"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Fisheye-from-GoPro-Footage" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Fisheye from GoPro Footage"></a>How to Remove Fisheye from GoPro Footage</h2><h3 id="Section-1-Enable-Linear-FOV-mode"><a href="#Section-1-Enable-Linear-FOV-mode" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: Enable Linear FOV mode"></a><strong>Section 1: Enable Linear FOV mode</strong></h3><p><strong>What is Linear FOV Mode</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is developed with various latest shooting modes and Linear FOV mode is one of those.

This feature lets you preview documents and images before uploading them on apps like Skype, Facebook, and more. But what happens if you want to preview videos, audio, spreadsheets, ZIP, and more? In that case, install <strong>QuickLook for Windows</strong>. So, what exactly is <strong>QuickLook for Windows 10,</strong> and where can you get this app? For answers and more, read to the end.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Download-Quick-Look-App-on-Microsoft-Store"><a href="#Part-1-Download-Quick-Look-App-on-Microsoft-Store" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Download Quick Look App on Microsoft Store"></a>Part 1: Download Quick Look App on Microsoft Store</h2><p>If your computer is always handling documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, presentations, images, and other files, it’s probably time to install <strong>QuickLook for Mac</strong> and Windows. This intelligent program lets you quickly preview files without opening them on separate apps. Just think of it as the “file viewer” feature on Windows File Explorer, which allows you to view files before loading online or opening them on local apps. Of course, this can help you know which app can open the file and if it’s the correct file to open.</p><p>But although the inbuilt file viewer is excellent to use, it has limited capabilities. For example, you cannot preview zipped files. Also, this inbuilt function cannot preview media files like audio and video. For this reason, install QuickLook for Windows and preview everything on your PC. And by the way, it’s absolutely free to use and comes bundled with a media player to open compatible video and audio formats.</p><p>Below is how to install and use QuickLook by Paddy Xu:</p><p>Step1 Open Microsoft Store and search for QuickLook. Make sure you select the option published by Paddy Xu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="search for quicklook for windows on Microsoft store"                ></p><p>Step2 Once you find QuickLook, click “Get it” to download and install the app in your Windows operating system. At around 60MB, installing this preview app should be quick and easy.</p><p>Step3 After successfully installing QuickLook, head to File Explorer and select any file you want to preview. Press the “Space” bar on your keyboard to view the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="preview video on quicklook for windows"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, you won’t preview the content inside the document file. Instead, you’ll only see details like the file type&#x2F;format, size, image name, and more. You can also directly choose the opening app. As for videos and audio, the media file will automatically play on the QuickLook media player. But don’t fret because the following section will teach you to read your documents, presentations, PDFs, and other files on QuickLook without opening the file.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Get-the-App-on-GitHub"><a href="#Part-2-Get-the-App-on-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Get the App on GitHub"></a>Part 2: Get the App on GitHub</h2><p>If you can’t find QuickLook on Microsoft Store for one reason or another, download the program from GitHub. It’s an open-source community where millions of software developers converge to distribute and share their work. Here, you can download and install multiple desktop programs and plugins for free. However, you must be a registered member to contribute any content.</p><p>So, without wasting time, let’s go through the steps to download the QuickLook plugin from GitHub. Follow me!</p><p>Step1 Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook" >QuickLook GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> page and then navigate to Releases. Click the latest version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-3.jpg"                      alt="click the latest quicklook for windows version"                ></p><p>Step2 Scroll down and download the .msi file. After downloading the installation file successfully, install it on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-4.jpg"                      alt="install the quicklook for windows msi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001446/11832" target="_top" id="1001446">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001446" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001446/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 Now go back to the QuickLook GitHub home page and click <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Available-Plugins" >plugin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Then, download the plugins to add additional preview capabilities to Microsoft QuickLook. For example, install the FontViewer, FFmpeg, and OfficeViewer plugins by clicking the respective “Link” buttons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-5.jpg"                      alt="install quicklook for windows plugins"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925473/19272" target="_top" id="1925473">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925473" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925473/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step4 After a successful installation, find the file you want to preview and select it. Then, tap the space bar to preview the files. And remember, browse ZIP files to view all content.</p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: We recommend installing the QuickLook OfficeViewer plugin to rip open your Office files and view the content inside. This method is recommended if you haven’t installed Microsoft Office on your PC. However, you might notice that the OfficeViewer plugin isn’t supported on your Windows PC. So to install OfficeViewer, select the file and click the space bar to preview it on QuickLook. Then, tap the “Click here to install this plugin” button. Now restart QuickLook and view all your office documents without opening them on their respective programs.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Should-We-Expect-Built-in-Quick-Look-on-Windows-in-the-Future"><a href="#Part-3-Should-We-Expect-Built-in-Quick-Look-on-Windows-in-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Should We Expect Built-in Quick Look on Windows in the Future?"></a>Part 3: Should We Expect Built-in Quick Look on Windows in the Future?</h2><p>Mac users have enjoyed the powerful QuickLook capabilities for at least 15 years. But are we going to see QuickLook coming to Windows 10&#x2F;11 anytime soon? According to sources, plans are already underway to add this feature to Microsoft Windows and rename it Peek. After selecting a file on Explorer, simply tap the Shift + Space bar to preview the content. Like the macOS version, you can preview PDFs, Excels, Words, images, videos, audio, and pretty much anything.</p><p>Meanwhile, it’s expected that QuickLook will come with a small preview screen. However, that should be enough space to preview whatever file you’re searching for. Also, it’s expected that Windows will embed the QuickLook capabilities into the Photos app. But it’s not yet clear if Peek will work with media files like videos and audio as it is on Mac.</p><p>In other related news, Microsoft will be answering the prayers of their loyal patrons to get tabbed browsing. This is another feature similar to what you currently have on macOS, where you can open new tabs for numerous file locations. In return, this makes moving and copying files more straightforward. This easy-to-navigate addition will definitely make Microsoft Windows users more productive than before.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148643/16836" target="_top" id="2148643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="75"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148643/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h4 id="1-Which-digital-file-formats-are-compatible-with-QuickLook"><a href="#1-Which-digital-file-formats-are-compatible-with-QuickLook" class="headerlink" title="1.

For image formats, you can preview PNG, APNG, JPG, GIF, PSD, and MP4. You can also preview media files like MP3, M4A, MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, and more. And, of course, QuickLook supports all sorts of document files, including PDF and CSV.
