But on the flip side, there are many issues related to the 4Kresolution like slow video upload speed, high storage, incompatibility with the majority of the device, and similar others.</p><p>Thus, considering these in mind, we can say that 1080p is quite a good resolution for your YouTube and other videos, and thus upscaling it to 4K is not a good or a better choice.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a><strong>Final Words</strong></h2><p>So, if you are facing trouble uploading 4K videos on YouTube, downscaling and converting them to 1080p is the best solution without compromising on the file quality. Any one of the above-listed offline or online YouTube video converter can be considered for this task. Among the above-listed ones, we would recommend using Wondershare Filmora as it works as a complete video editing toolbox that will help you with several other video editing and customization tasks.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Supported OS: Windows and Mac</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254549&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/8_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#2-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

Is 1080p upscaled to 4K really better?"></a>2. Is 1080p upscaled to 4K really better?</h3><p>A 4K video is undoubtedly high in quality and can be used only when some specific content is needed. But on the flip side, there are many issues related to the 4Kresolution like slow video upload speed, high storage, incompatibility with the majority of the device, and similar others.</p><p>Thus, considering these in mind, we can say that 1080p is quite a good resolution for your YouTube and other videos, and thus upscaling it to 4K is not a good or a better choice.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a><strong>Final Words</strong></h2><p>So, if you are facing trouble uploading 4K videos on YouTube, downscaling and converting them to 1080p is the best solution without compromising on the file quality. Any one of the above-listed offline or online YouTube video converter can be considered for this task. Among the above-listed ones, we would recommend using Wondershare Filmora as it works as a complete video editing toolbox that will help you with several other video editing and customization tasks.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-boosting-social-reach-top-facebook-video-engagement-techniques/"><u>[New] Boosting Social Reach  Top Facebook Video Engagement Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-facebooks-best-friend-on-mobile-top-10-android-extractor-apps-overview-for-2024/"><u>[New] Facebook's Best Friend on Mobile  Top 10 Android Extractor Apps Overview for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-tactics-to-triumph-secrets-of-successful-social-media-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Tactics to Triumph  Secrets of Successful Social Media Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-record-mov-files-on-windows-11/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Record MOV Files on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-channel-titling-101-the-quest-for-an-original-label/"><u>[Updated] Channel Titling 101  The Quest for an Original Label</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-download-facebook-videos-on-windows-and-mac-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Download Facebook Videos on Windows and Mac for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-imovie-clip-integration-into-youtubes-vast-network/"><u>[Updated] IMovie Clip Integration Into YouTube's Vast Network</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-dji-drone-tiers-entry-level-advanced-professional-visionary/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, DJI Drone Tiers  Entry Level, Advanced, Professional Visionary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-leading-economical-screen-snapper-kit/"><u>[Updated] Leading Economical Screen Snapper Kit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/10-free-legal-chants-and-sounds-for-meditation-practice/"><u>10 Free Legal Chants and Sounds for Meditation Practice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-quick-guide-to-firefoxs-innovative-pip-mode/"><u>2024 Approved  A Quick Guide to Firefox's Innovative PIP Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-androids-guide-to-spinning-and-combining-video-files/"><u>2024 Approved  Android's Guide to Spinning & Combining Video Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-are-reviews-on-goods-and-services-for-cash/"><u>2024 Approved  Are Reviews on Goods & Services for Cash?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-beyond-the-screen-ultimate-vr-gadget-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Beyond the Screen -

Thankfully there are certain GoPro settings which can be tweaked to maximize the GoPro battery life and in this article we are going to discuss a few easy ways of improving your GoPro battery life. On an average the battery of your GoPro would last just for about 1 ½ hours or even less while shooting in 4K with the LCD screen on and Wi-Fi connected.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Batteries and Chargers for GoPro Hero5 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Improve-GoPro’s-Battery-life"><a href="#How-to-Improve-GoPro’s-Battery-life" class="headerlink" title="How to Improve GoPro’s Battery life"></a>How to Improve GoPro’s Battery life</h2><h4 id="1-Update-the-firmware"><a href="#1-Update-the-firmware" class="headerlink" title="1. Update the firmware"></a>1. Update the firmware</h4><p> Are you still not taking the firmware updates of your camera seriously? Though most action camera shooters do not have the time to ponder over all those tech stuff, yet you need to keep your camera’s firmware updated if you are looking forward to conserving your battery. There is always a possibility that your GoPro firmware isn’t actually updated. Doing this would not just fix any recurrent problems which you might be having with your camera but it would also improve the battery life immensely because of any fixes implemented by the company. The GoPro firmware can be updated by connecting the cam to a smartphone over Wi-Fi and then by updating it with the help of the GoPro app. In case you are using an older model you have to download the firmware which is available on the GoPro website and then transfer it to your GoPro SD card and run the update from your cam.</p><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M14ATO0/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01M14ATO0&linkId=5ce54ea937ecffa6b1b8056b6922abaa" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>2. Keep the cam turned off when not in use</p><p> This sounds pretty obvious doesn’t it? When you turn on your camera but not recording anything then the battery gets drains slowly. So make sure to keep your GoPro switched off whenever you are not shooting so as to save the battery. The Quick Capture is an useful feature which allows the cam to start recording instantly whenever it is powered on.</p><h4 id="3-Use-the-“Auto-Power-Off-Setting”"><a href="#3-Use-the-“Auto-Power-Off-Setting”" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the “Auto Power Off Setting”"></a>3. Use the “Auto Power Off Setting”</h4><p> Many of us forget to switch on our cameras after shooting and this slowly depletes the camera’s battery. If you are one of those people who always forget to turn off the camera only to find a low battery indication after some time then what you need to do is turn on the ‘Auto Power Off Setting’. All you have to do is go to the settings menu and then click on the button 13 times till you have the option to select the number of seconds you would like to give your cam till it shuts down automatically. You can choose from 60, 120, and 300 seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-auto-power-off-setting.jpg"                      alt="Save GoPro battery life"                ></p><h4 id="4-Turn-off-the-red-indicator-and-beeping-lights"><a href="#4-Turn-off-the-red-indicator-and-beeping-lights" class="headerlink" title="4. Turn off the red indicator and beeping lights"></a>4. Turn off the red indicator and beeping lights</h4><p> The red light which constantly blinks while shooting a footage is not just a major distraction to the viewer but also a cause of battery drainage. This red indicator light is meant for letting the user know when the cam is recording. However professional cinematographers will easily learn that as long as the record button is pressed properly the GoPro is going to start shooting no matter if the red light is blinking or not. Though the light indicator doesn’t have that much of an impact on the overall battery life but when it comes to battery life improvement every little thing helps.</p><h4 id="5-Turn-off-the-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth"><a href="#5-Turn-off-the-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="5. Turn off the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth"></a>5. Turn off the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</h4><p> Just like any other devices, turning off the WIFI and Bluetooth in your GoPro cam can greatly help to enhance the battery life. Turning of these 2 could extend your battery life by about 10-15 minutes. Make sure not to accidentally press the WIFI button at the side of your camera while shooting.</p><h4 id="6-Give-up-the-Remote-and-the-smartphone-app"><a href="#6-Give-up-the-Remote-and-the-smartphone-app" class="headerlink" title="6. Give up the Remote and the smartphone app"></a>6. Give up the Remote and the smartphone app</h4><p> The remote control of your GoPro is not just difficult to use but also takes a toll on the battery life of the camera. It could lower the overall battery life of your cam by about 15%-20% depending on the usage. Try using a selfie stick instead of the remote. Avoid pairing your cam with your phone since it’s more of a wastage of your time and the camera battery. So leave the remote behind and stop playing with your smartphone so as to shoot a lot more footage with your GoPro.</p><h4 id="7-Reduce-the-frame-rate-or-the-recording-resolution"><a href="#7-Reduce-the-frame-rate-or-the-recording-resolution" class="headerlink" title="7. Reduce the frame rate or the recording resolution"></a>7. Reduce the frame rate or the recording resolution</h4><p> Always keep in mind that the less the number of pixels and frames your camera is recording the less battery it uses. Try to have the video setting of your GoPro set to 1080p but for a special reason to shoot in ultra HD. Also make sure to turn off the Protune feature in your camera. The 1080p at 60 fps is the norm for shooting any GoPro footage. However you can always reduce it to 720p or leave it at 1080p only with 30 frames per sec instead of 60 unless you are shooting a professional video with the best possible res. If you are just shooting for fun then 720p is surely going to work great and more importantly it would give you more footage in the end.</p><h4 id="8-Keep-the-LCD-screen-turned-off"><a href="#8-Keep-the-LCD-screen-turned-off" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep the LCD screen turned off"></a>8. Keep the LCD screen turned off</h4><p> The LCD screens in the new GroPro are a superb feature which not only allows you to see whatever you are recording but also change the setting more conveniently. However the LCD screen can substantially drain the battery so when you want to capture more footage its best for you to turn off the LCD and shoot in the old school way.</p><h4 id="9-Get-extra-batteries-or-an-extended-battery-pack"><a href="#9-Get-extra-batteries-or-an-extended-battery-pack" class="headerlink" title="9. Get extra batteries or an extended battery pack"></a>9. Get extra batteries or an extended battery pack</h4><p> Surely this is one of the easiest ways of getting the most out of your GoPro camera. You can just buy a few spare batteries from the 3rd party vendors at a very affordable price so that you don’t have to worry about shooting to your heart’s content.</p><p><img

This can be done using various devices, such as smart gloves, often known as data gloves.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss <strong>Hand Tracking</strong> technology, its various applications, and how to create it using Python, OpenCV, and Media Pipe.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Tracking With Interface</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Tracking Without Interface</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">What is OpenCV</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">What Is Media Pipe</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Guidance With Steps</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Use Filmora to demonstarte your Hand Tracking skill</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=32667153&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.coolmuster.com/uploads/image/20201228/feature02.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698824&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3pro-screenshot-homepage.png"                      border="0"                >PCDJ DEX 3 for Windows &amp; MAC is the total entertainment DJ software solution, offering audio, video, and karaoke mixing ability.

What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

To please the pickiest of fashion-forward tech lovers, Skagen released the Falster 2, a fully-featured Wear OS smartwatch that has the classic aesthetic of Skagen’s traditional watches.</p><p> It has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >all the functionality you could ever ask in a premium smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , such as swim tracking, remote pay, heart rate monitoring, and more. Unfortunately, not everything about this watch is breathtaking. It runs on older hardware, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100 Wear processor, which hampers its performance speed. If you can tolerate a bit of lag, however, it’s a joy to wear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R5aH7_KFwIdQ1LE3atOJ9BdgDA8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4157747-3-af2f2375484c4ea786128d13610e49f5.jpg"                      alt="Skagen Falster 2"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-Eye-catching-and-practical"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-Eye-catching-and-practical" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort: Eye-catching and practical"></a><strong>Design and Comfort: Eye-catching and practical</strong></h2><p> The Skagen Falster 2 is easily one of the most beautiful smartwatches on the market. We reviewed the rose gold mesh strap version, which blended seamlessly with any outfit in our wardrobe, from poolside to black tie. The watch is 40mm wide with 20mm standard straps, so should you want to switch the straps, you have a lot of customization options. The 1.2-inch<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display is sharp, with bright colors and good visibility. On the bezel, there is a center crown for scrolling through apps and two extra crowns that can be preset to any app.</p><p> The Falster 2 is a well-built smartwatch that could last a long time, software and hardware limitations aside.</p><p> This gives users the opportunity to use Google Pay with the tap of a crown, for instance. The watch is incredibly light, and its slim profile makes it easy to forget you’re wearing it. When we slept with it on, we had no problems with comfort.</p><p> For those who lead a more active lifestyle, the Falster 2 has 3ATM water resistance and passed a 10,000 stroke swim test. We put it through daily wear, leaving it with keys, and using it as we drove cars, carried luggage, and biked. There were no scratches despite regular use.

You follow the directions on the app and you’ll be ready to go in five minutes. For those who use iPhones, don’t worry; Wear OS works on iOS as well. You can download apps from the Wear OS app or directly on the watch through the Play Store app, and it comes with a solid set of pre-installed apps. Some of our favorites are Google Keep, Spotify, and Foursquare.</p><p> For those who use iPhones, don’t worry; Wear OS works on iOS as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/PcILVr4gJEKDBrH6unuOLj--8J0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4157747-2-e2462b088cdb45a2a418486db9d36845.jpg"                      alt="Skagen Falster 2"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Sometimes-slow-but-accurate"><a href="#Performance-Sometimes-slow-but-accurate" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Sometimes slow, but accurate"></a><strong>Performance: Sometimes slow, but accurate</strong></h2><p> Unfortunately, the Falster 2 is only truly beautiful on the outside. It has NFC, GPS, and heart rate monitoring, but that means little if the OS lags. When we were using the smartwatch, we would regularly see momentary slumps in performance, where apps would take a couple seconds to load. While there could be many factors behind the lag, it’s likely that the Falster 2’s outdated Qualcomm 2100 chipset is the main culprit.</p><p> When we were using the smartwatch, we would regularly see momentary slumps in performance, where apps would take a couple seconds to load.</p><p> There wasn’t enough lag to completely turn us off, as it was fast enough most of the time, but this may be a dealbreaker for those that like to live on the bleeding edge of tech. Other users have reported harsher lag than we experienced (apps would take five seconds or more to load for them according to some reports), but Skagen has been working with Google to cut down on the wait time. The NFC works, and the GPS and heart rate monitors are as accurate as any other high-end smartwatch. Because the Falster 2 is swim-proof, it also does a solid job of tracking pool laps.</p><h2 id="Battery-Nothing-noteworthy"><a href="#Battery-Nothing-noteworthy" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Nothing noteworthy"></a><strong>Battery: Nothing noteworthy</strong></h2><p> Like the lag, we did not seem to experience the issues that other users have been having. A lot of users have groaned about the Falster 2’s battery life, clocking it at just under a day of usage on a full charge, but we were able to get two days out of the Falster 2. On days with heavier usage, the Falster 2 usually lasted about 30 hours before we had to recharge, with constant notifications, location, and NFC enabled.</p><p> There is an option to keep the screen always on, which understandably drains the battery much faster. With the always-on screen enabled, we confidently wore it to bed without worrying it would die overnight. When we had to charge, it took a little over an hour to get back to a full charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GxKZixkTY4mBDqWCBaxjYYukZ0A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4157747-4-934f784290894a6b8b9f02262c7bb2ab.jpg"                      alt="Skagen Falster 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Software-and-Key-Features-It’ll-fit-your-mold"><a href="#Software-and-Key-Features-It’ll-fit-your-mold" class="headerlink" title="Software and Key Features: It’ll fit your mold"></a><strong>Software and Key Features: It’ll fit your mold</strong></h2><p> The Skagen Falster 2 comes with a heart rate monitor, NFC, GPS, music storage and playback, and voice command.

One of the watch’s most interesting features is that it’s waterproof, allowing it to track swimming activity. We’re not so sure the paint finish would hold up in a pool’s harsh chemicals, but it’s great to know the internals would be unharmed.

Features-wise, the watch’s greatest shortcoming is its responsiveness. It regularly lags, taking a second or more to switch applications during normal use.

Responsiveness aside, it’s a very well-crafted watch that looks as expensive as it is. There are better value smartwatches for those that prize functionality, but the Falster 2 is about as expensive as its other fashion smartwatch counterparts.</p><h2 id="Competition-No-need-to-sacrifice-function-for-style"><a href="#Competition-No-need-to-sacrifice-function-for-style" class="headerlink" title="Competition: No need to sacrifice function for style"></a><strong>Competition: No need to sacrifice function for style</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Michael Kors Sofie Heart Rate Wristwatch</em></strong> : This beautiful smartwatch from Michael Kors also runs on Wear OS, provides snappy feedback, and will make your wrist feel stunning. It’s a little more expensive than the Falster 2, and it’s a lot chunkier on those with smaller wrists, but we think it’s a great alternative smartwatch.</p><p><em><strong>Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch</strong> :</em> Skagen is owned by Fossil, so it should come as no surprise that the Gen 5 smartwatch looks almost exactly like the Falster 2. It retails for $295, like the Falster 2, but it comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor that outshines the Falster 2’s 2100 processor. The Gen 5 offers everything you could ever ask for in a smartwatch, from swim tracking to remote payment, and it comes wrapped up in a gorgeous metallic package.</p><p><strong><em>Apple Watch Series 4</em></strong> : If you own an iPhone, then the Apple Watch Series 4 is undeniably the best smartwatch you can get in the same price range. It comes with the robust App Store, packs in the most features of any smartwatch, and looks beautiful. Granted, it very much looks like a smartwatch, but it’s easy to customize the straps with the ubiquitous first-party and third-party straps. The Series 4 also introduces an FDA-approved ECG, a bigger and clearer screen, 18 hours of battery life, and a louder speaker.

These videographers or video companies are putting in the work to make sure their business will come up on the site. When you look at their website, first watch their video reel. This is their version of an elevator pitch. They have a minuet to show you some if their best work to get you to use their services. If they provide quality services, they will have some of their full videos on their website. Watch at least a couple of their full videos will ensure that their video skills are quality. If they don’t have any full video on their site, ask them for a reel or consider someone else.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Freelance-Website"><a href="#Freelance-Website" class="headerlink" title="Freelance Website"></a>Freelance Website</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/find-videographer-freelance-website.jpg"                      alt="find videographer freelance website"                ></p><p>One final option is going on a freelance website to find a videographer.

People who work on freelance websites will upload their portfolio and wait for someone like you who needs their services to come along. These most freelancers are college students who studying something about videography or photography. Sometimes the freelancers are those who don’t have a company yet or are just starting out in business but they are good in covered such events, you can always ask for proof like, shorts video or a copy of some photos. Not all professional videographer is equal. Each one brings their own experience and artistic eye to a project. There are those that specialize in wedding.

Talk to your colleagues and friends who have hired video professionals, and ask them for recommendations. It can save you a lot of time and effort.</p><p>For best results, as with any project you outsource, it is imperative to be very clear about your expectations and your timeline. The right professional will ask a lot of questions up front and deliver result on time.</p><p>And let’s be honest you can often negotiate a discount price if the person knows their recommendation well. So feel free to go to different people in your network to wind up with to three options, then evaluate the videographers and pick the best one.</p><p>So don’t be shy to ask a friend, a family or a colleagues if they know someone who is a good videographer that they will recommend to catch your special event.</p><p>Sometimes it’s better to just get a recommended one since you’ll have a hard time looking for it everywhere.</p><h3 id="Marketing-Agency-1"><a href="#Marketing-Agency-1" class="headerlink" title="Marketing Agency"></a>Marketing Agency</h3><p>There are also many marketing agencies that you can go to find a videographer but of course you only need to find a trustworthy agency. Don’t forget to take a close look at their latest work, do a research about the videographer site first because there you can read recommendations or comments from their clients about the videographer work.</p><p>Shop around and try to find a studio that can accommodate your budget. Always check their past work extensively to see if their style will translate well for your needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/find-videographer-marketing-agency.jpg"                      alt="find videographer marketing agency"                ></p><h3 id="Google-Search-1"><a href="#Google-Search-1" class="headerlink" title="Google Search"></a>Google Search</h3><p>You can always search on google a videographer that is near to you area and for fast transactions you can private message them and always make sure you did a lot of research about them so that you will not waste your time and effort.</p><p>When you google video production company or food videographers consider first looking at the top three organic results. These videographers or video companies are putting in the work to make sure their business will come up on the site. When you look at their website, first watch their video reel. This is their version of an elevator pitch. They have a minuet to show you some if their best work to get you to use their services. If they provide quality services, they will have some of their full videos on their website. Watch at least a couple of their full videos will ensure that their video skills are quality.

A freelance website works to connect people that aren’t looking for permanent hire or short-term business, most likely on some event like weddings. People who work on freelance websites will upload their portfolio and wait for someone like you who needs their services to come along. These most freelancers are college students who studying something about videography or photography. Sometimes the freelancers are those who don’t have a company yet or are just starting out in business but they are good in covered such events, you can always ask for proof like, shorts video or a copy of some photos. Not all professional videographer is equal. Each one brings their own experience and artistic eye to a project. There are those that specialize in wedding. Capturing that special day and editing it together in just the right way is a skill set.</p><p>An event video captures the essence of an occasions. The memories and moments shared throughout are captures in a way that is not possible with photos alone. When it comes on the costing of the videographer, it is depended on the time spent to the event and the extras to be added on the contract. But if you want to save money you can edit a wedding or birth video to your specification, so you can relive this moment for years to come.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Learning-the-Art-of-Softly-Amplifying-Audio-Tracks"><a href="#Learning-the-Art-of-Softly-Amplifying-Audio-Tracks" class="headerlink" title="Learning the Art of Softly Amplifying Audio Tracks"></a>Learning the Art of Softly Amplifying Audio Tracks</h2><p>Adobe Audition, developed by Adobe Inc is a digital audio workstation. This is a great application one can use, for sound effect designing or video podcasting, to record and&#x2F;or mix audio. Audition has two modes, accessible by clicking on the Waveform or Multitrack buttons present at the top, or by double clicking to open an audio file or multitrack session in the Files panel. Audition has several panels, each with a unique set of features.</p><p>Effects can be implemented at the same time by choosing them from the Effects menu or as a list in the Effects bar, enabling you to test with effect combinations before implementing them. Presets help you get started, and detailed controls allow you to fine-tune your adjustments. You can also batch-process audio files to remove 60 Hz hum or fit the amplitude of clips. It can be done using a variety of measures, including industry standard Broadcast Loudness options.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Steps-to-Adobe-Audition-Fade-In"><a href="#Part-1-Steps-to-Adobe-Audition-Fade-In" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Steps to Adobe Audition Fade In"></a>Part 1. Steps to Adobe Audition Fade In</h2><p>The multitrack view includes a comprehensive set of non-destructive editing tools and audio mixing. The changes you make in this mode have no effect on your original audio files. You can make multiple modifications to multitrack clips immediately, making it simple to quickly adjust a mix.</p><p>Consider adjusting the level of a clip to create it more audible. In audio transitions, fading is widely used. With Fade it, the sound begins silently and slowly increases to full volume. With Adobe audition fade out, the audio begins at full volume and slightly declines to silence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/start-adobe-audition-audio-edit_.jpg"                      alt="start adobe audition audio edit"                ></p><p>If you have audio that starts quite abruptly and you’d like to add a fade, Audition makes this very easy. Here are some steps to follow:</p><ul><li>First, you have to do successful installation completion of Adobe Audition software.</li><li>Open Adobe Audition and then opt for the selection of your desired audio file. You will notice that where it is dark, you will get a square broken into 2 triangles, one at the top left and one at the top right.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/2-triangles-square.jpg"                      alt="2 triangles square"                ></p><ul><li>Now, if you point these out, you will spot them on every piece of audio you open and if you hover the mouse over that, the left one is called Fade In. The right one is Fade Out.</li><li>Now, if you pull the Heads-Up Display out of the way and click and then drag right on the icon, you will see a fade in there which is a little bit longer than you need.</li><li>If you go up to your Effects menu and go to your Amplitude and Compression section, you have got a Fade Envelope and a Gain Envelope.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/amplitude-and-compression-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="amplitude and compression adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now, if you choose Fade Envelope and of course, it is giving you the fade right the way through the audio. It will adjust for you and this is based on a Smooth Fade In.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/fade-envelop-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="fade envelop adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now, go back to the Effects, Amplitude, and Compression and Click on Fade Envelope. Then, choose a Smooth Fade Out and there you will see after zooming a little bit more, a yellow line has been drawn to show what fade effect is going to be applied.</li><li>If you click on this yellow line, you can drag it in situ and reshape it any way you want and you can create any kind of stepped fade you want.</li><li>If you go back into your effects, go back into Amplitude and Compression and this time, Choose Gain envelope. Now, you will get the yellow line flowing right the way through the audio.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/gain-envelop-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="gain envelop adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now exactly, in the same way, you can go in and begin to make adjustments. Now, when you make a selection here, Audition compresses your adjustments into that selected region. You will need to be a little careful about that when working with these effects. So, you can add fades very easily at any time by clicking on the handles at the top right and left of Waveform Display, or you can use dedicated effects for the purpose.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Audition-Alternative-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-2-Audition-Alternative-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Stepwise-Guide-to-Smoothing-Out-Audio-Dynamics"><a href="#Stepwise-Guide-to-Smoothing-Out-Audio-Dynamics" class="headerlink" title="Stepwise Guide to Smoothing Out Audio Dynamics"></a>Stepwise Guide to Smoothing Out Audio Dynamics</h2><p>Adobe Audition, developed by Adobe Inc is a digital audio workstation. This is a great application one can use, for sound effect designing or video podcasting, to record and&#x2F;or mix audio. Audition has two modes, accessible by clicking on the Waveform or Multitrack buttons present at the top, or by double clicking to open an audio file or multitrack session in the Files panel. Audition has several panels, each with a unique set of features.</p><p>Effects can be implemented at the same time by choosing them from the Effects menu or as a list in the Effects bar, enabling you to test with effect combinations before implementing them. Presets help you get started, and detailed controls allow you to fine-tune your adjustments. You can also batch-process audio files to remove 60 Hz hum or fit the amplitude of clips. It can be done using a variety of measures, including industry standard Broadcast Loudness options.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Steps-to-Adobe-Audition-Fade-In"><a href="#Part-1-Steps-to-Adobe-Audition-Fade-In" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Steps to Adobe Audition Fade In"></a>Part 1. Steps to Adobe Audition Fade In</h2><p>The multitrack view includes a comprehensive set of non-destructive editing tools and audio mixing. The changes you make in this mode have no effect on your original audio files. You can make multiple modifications to multitrack clips immediately, making it simple to quickly adjust a mix.</p><p>Consider adjusting the level of a clip to create it more audible. In audio transitions, fading is widely used. With Fade it, the sound begins silently and slowly increases to full volume. With Adobe audition fade out, the audio begins at full volume and slightly declines to silence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/start-adobe-audition-audio-edit_.jpg"                      alt="start adobe audition audio edit"                ></p><p>If you have audio that starts quite abruptly and you’d like to add a fade, Audition makes this very easy. Here are some steps to follow:</p><ul><li>First, you have to do successful installation completion of Adobe Audition software.</li><li>Open Adobe Audition and then opt for the selection of your desired audio file. You will notice that where it is dark, you will get a square broken into 2 triangles, one at the top left and one at the top right.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/2-triangles-square.jpg"                      alt="2 triangles square"                ></p><ul><li>Now, if you point these out, you will spot them on every piece of audio you open and if you hover the mouse over that, the left one is called Fade In. The right one is Fade Out.</li><li>Now, if you pull the Heads-Up Display out of the way and click and then drag right on the icon, you will see a fade in there which is a little bit longer than you need.</li><li>If you go up to your Effects menu and go to your Amplitude and Compression section, you have got a Fade Envelope and a Gain Envelope.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/amplitude-and-compression-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="amplitude and compression adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now, if you choose Fade Envelope and of course, it is giving you the fade right the way through the audio. It will adjust for you and this is based on a Smooth Fade In.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/fade-envelop-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="fade envelop adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now, go back to the Effects, Amplitude, and Compression and Click on Fade Envelope. Then, choose a Smooth Fade Out and there you will see after zooming a little bit more, a yellow line has been drawn to show what fade effect is going to be applied.</li><li>If you click on this yellow line, you can drag it in situ and reshape it any way you want and you can create any kind of stepped fade you want.</li><li>If you go back into your effects, go back into Amplitude and Compression and this time, Choose Gain envelope. Now, you will get the yellow line flowing right the way through the audio.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/gain-envelop-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="gain envelop adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now exactly, in the same way, you can go in and begin to make adjustments. Now, when you make a selection here, Audition compresses your adjustments into that selected region. You will need to be a little careful about that when working with these effects. So, you can add fades very easily at any time by clicking on the handles at the top right and left of Waveform Display, or you can use dedicated effects for the purpose.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Audition-Alternative-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-2-Audition-Alternative-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Depending on your requirement, adjust the shutter timer intervals. Be careful to make the intervals in proper line with the shooting needs. Once you are done with the shooting, take these photos to the GoPro Studio to create your time-lapse video.</p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><ol><li>You need less space for storing the snapshots on the memory card. This method is convenient if you want to shoot for long hours and even for days together.</li><li>It saves your battery life compared to continuous video shooting</li><li>With 12mp high-resolution photos, it becomes easy to process the videos while adding zoom and panning effects. It gives you optimal quality video output compared to shooting standard videos and processing them</li></ol><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><ol><li>You need to shoot many photos at the small intervals or else your final video may look jumpy with poor quality</li><li>The process of shooting photos at regular intervals is a complicated job (only recommended for experienced photographers)</li></ol><p> <strong>How to Take Photos for the Time Lapse Videos</strong></p><p> Depending on the theme and object of your GoPro time lapse video, you can set the shutter timer interval anywhere from 0.5 seconds to 60 seconds. Plan the time lapse sequence properly to ensure high quality video output. In general, you will need about 250 photos to create a professional industry standard time-lapse video of 10 seconds (running at 25fps).</p><ol><li>Turn on the GoPro Hero4 camera</li><li>Use the front button or the GoPro app to select ‘Multi shot’</li><li>Use the GoPro app or press the ‘settings’ button located on the side of your camera</li><li>Adjust the setting including resolution, shutter timer interval, image size, toggle ProTune, focus point etc.</li><li>Now start framing your object of the video and press the button on the top to start clicking the images</li></ol><h4 id="Method-2-Shoot-and-Raise-the-Speed-of-a-Standard-Video"><a href="#Method-2-Shoot-and-Raise-the-Speed-of-a-Standard-Video" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Shoot and Raise the Speed of a Standard Video"></a><strong>Method 2: Shoot and Raise the Speed of a Standard Video</strong></h4><p> In this process, you need to set your GoPro camera to shoot a continuous standard video (preferably at 1080p).

This is one the best GoPro time lapse tips suited for novice photographers to produce the top quality time-lapse videos with sublime beauty. All you need to do is set your GoPro Hero4 or 5 camera on the 4K time-lapse mode and adjust the desired interval settings. The feature offers 4K time-lapse video capturing, which is double the resolution seen in HD videos.</p><p> After you are done with the shooting process, the GoPro will automatically compress the entire video into an MP4 time-lapse video file of 30fps. You do not have to do the rigorous postproduction video processing.</p><p> <strong>Pros</strong></p><ol><li>Best quality video output that gives incredible results with zoom or panning effect without the risk of losing details</li><li>The LCD screen will show the captured video time so that you are able to calculate the video length instantly</li><li>The video is small and stored in the MPEG file format, which is quite easy to process later on with zoom, panning etc</li></ol><p> <strong>Cons</strong></p><ol><li>Required extended battery (you may need to use an USB power source in case of shooting lasts for over hours)</li></ol><p><strong>How to Shoot Video on the 4K Time-Lapse Mode</strong></p><ol><li>Turn on the GoPro Camera (You must use Hero4 or 5 version to access this feature)</li><li>Use the front button or the GoPro app to select ‘Video’</li><li>Use the GoPro app or press the ‘Settings’ button located on the side of your camera</li><li>From the menu top, choose ‘T Lapse Vid’</li><li>Adjust your settings including photo size (4:3, 2.7K, 4K), interval time etc</li><li>Press the top button once you have set the camera in the desired position to start recording the video</li></ol><h2 id="Other-GoPro-Time-Lapse-Shooting-Tips"><a href="#Other-GoPro-Time-Lapse-Shooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Other GoPro Time Lapse Shooting Tips"></a>Other GoPro Time Lapse Shooting Tips</h2><h4 id="1-Use-a-Solid-GoPro-Compatible-Tripod"><a href="#1-Use-a-Solid-GoPro-Compatible-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="1.

Use a Solid GoPro Compatible Tripod</h4><p> Without the tripod, it will become very hard to keep the camera firmly positioned towards the subject at a proper angle for hours. Using a tripod mount such as the Joby Gorillapod is a wise decision as it fixes well with the GoPro cameras.</p><h4 id="2-Use-Extended-Life-Battery"><a href="#2-Use-Extended-Life-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2.

It is wise to choose the micro SD card with a storage space of 32GB to 64 GB if you are planning to shoot for some days or a week.</p><h4 id="4-Dedicate-Time-into-the-Editing-Process"><a href="#4-Dedicate-Time-into-the-Editing-Process" class="headerlink" title="4.Dedicate Time into the Editing Process"></a>4.Dedicate Time into the Editing Process</h4><p> The time-lapse effect you need for your video will vary depending on the subject. For instance, if you are shooting sunset videos, it is good to go with 15fps settings. There is no fixed rule to getting going. The best thing is to keep experimenting and leverage time into the editing process.</p><h4 id="5-Set-Highest-Resolution-on-Your-Camera-12MP-for-Images-and-1080-4K-for-Videos"><a

AR Stands for augmented reality - a technology that combines the real world and digital content. You can use it to make fun images and videos. But how do you use this feature? And are there options for people without a Google Pixel phone?</p><p>In this article, we will take a look at this feature. Also, we will show you a great alternative that lets you experience the same but using other devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-ar-stickers-its-alternative.gif"                      alt="google ar stickers and its alternative"                ></p><h2 id="What-Is-Google-AR-Sticker"><a href="#What-Is-Google-AR-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="What Is Google AR Sticker?"></a>What Is Google AR Sticker?</h2><p>Think of stickers that you can put on images or videos. However, these stickers are in 3D. Furthermore, they look like they are actually in the environment or they are a part of your body. However, you can only see them through a camera lens.</p><p>You can look at Pokemon Go to understand it better. The game allows you to “place” your Pokemon in the real world and take photos of them. Google AR stickers are like that, except the stickers are not strictly only Pokemon. There are letters, food, Stranger Things characters, and more!</p><h2 id="History-of-Google-AR-Sticker"><a href="#History-of-Google-AR-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="History of Google AR Sticker"></a>History of Google AR Sticker</h2><p>Back in 2017, virtual reality and augmented reality received an increase in interest. While these technologies weren’t really new, it was at this time that they became common. Apps like Snapchat included AR stickers that allowed users to take photos and videos with their favorite fictional characters and such. Google hopped on the trend by incorporating AR stickers into its smartphone, Pixel 2.</p><p>The thing is that it did not last long. Ever since Google launched its Pixel 4a in 2020, they no longer provided AR stickers. The camera of the new devices is not compatible with AR stickers, Playground, and Playmoji. And that’s the end of Google AR Stickers.</p><p>Owners of older Pixel models should not worry since the devices’ hardware isn’t changed. Thus, they will continue to support Playground, the app needed to use Google AR Stickers.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Google-Playground-AR-Stickers-on-Pixel-4-and-Earlier"><a href="#How-To-Use-Google-Playground-AR-Stickers-on-Pixel-4-and-Earlier" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier"></a>How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier</h2><p>As mentioned above, older Pixel models still have Google Playground support. These devices are Pixel 4 and earlier. Meanwhile, Playmojis (3D AR Stickers) are available only for Pixel 3, 3a, and 4.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step tutorial on how to use this feature:</p><p>Step1 Ensure you have Android 8.1 (Oreo) installed on your Pixel.

It’s understandable since “augmented reality” sounds very advanced and complex. Here are some FAQs about it to make you more informed about the subject.</p><p><strong>Q1. What Are AR Stickers?</strong></p><p>AR stickers are augmented reality image effects you can add to improve photos or videos. They can be static images or animations. Some examples are eyeglasses, bunny headbands, hats, beards, or even animals or characters.</p><p>The application that offers it maps your face or the environment in the video and tracks movements. With that, they make it seem like the AR sticker is real instead of a virtual object.</p><p>Let’s suppose you added AR eyeglasses to the video you are recording. When you move, the eyeglasses will follow your eyes instead of staying where they originally were.</p><p><strong>Q2. Can You Use AR Without an App?</strong></p><p>Perhaps you don’t want to install custom AR apps. That’s not new. According to some studies, engagement drops by 50% when users need to download. So, some developers chose the WebAR path instead.</p><p>WebAR uses web technologies to let users experience augmented reality. All you need is a phone or any device with a camera and a web browser. Since most modern browsers and operating systems already support AR, WebAR makes the experience so accessible.</p><p><strong>Q3. Are AR Apps Safe?</strong></p><p>AR Apps can be dangerous, but not all of them are. Keep in mind that AR apps can see what you are doing in real-time. If that information falls into the wrong hands, you may end up in trouble.</p><p>Vendors can also add malware or other things to the apps. So it’s necessary that you always stay vigilant. As much as possible, download AR apps from vendors with a good reputation. That’s how you ensure the app is not doing something nasty behind your back.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537546&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/7_copy_2_2_hdpro.png"                      border="0"                >HD Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Google AR Stickers are great for enhancing your photos and videos.

It’s understandable since “augmented reality” sounds very advanced and complex. Here are some FAQs about it to make you more informed about the subject.</p><p><strong>Q1. What Are AR Stickers?</strong></p><p>AR stickers are augmented reality image effects you can add to improve photos or videos. They can be static images or animations. Some examples are eyeglasses, bunny headbands, hats, beards, or even animals or characters.</p><p>The application that offers it maps your face or the environment in the video and tracks movements. With that, they make it seem like the AR sticker is real instead of a virtual object.</p><p>Let’s suppose you added AR eyeglasses to the video you are recording. When you move, the eyeglasses will follow your eyes instead of staying where they originally were.</p><p><strong>Q2. Can You Use AR Without an App?</strong></p><p>Perhaps you don’t want to install custom AR apps. That’s not new. According to some studies, engagement drops by 50% when users need to download. So, some developers chose the WebAR path instead.</p><p>WebAR uses web technologies to let users experience augmented reality. All you need is a phone or any device with a camera and a web browser. Since most modern browsers and operating systems already support AR, WebAR makes the experience so accessible.</p><p><strong>Q3. Are AR Apps Safe?</strong></p><p>AR Apps can be dangerous, but not all of them are. Keep in mind that AR apps can see what you are doing in real-time. If that information falls into the wrong hands, you may end up in trouble.</p><p>Vendors can also add malware or other things to the apps. So it’s necessary that you always stay vigilant. As much as possible, download AR apps from vendors with a good reputation. That’s how you ensure the app is not doing something nasty behind your back.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Conclusion<p>Google AR Stickers are great for enhancing your photos and videos. Too bad it’s no longer available on newer Pixel devices. Luckily, other apps are available on the market, and they’re available on more platforms. For example, Wondershare Filmora for Mobile has an AR Camera feature. It lets you add AR stickers to your photos and videos, then combine and edit them. The selection of AR effects is also wide. So, you can have loads of fun creating content using Filmora for Mobile.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unleash-your-auditory-adventures-installing-apple-podcasts-app/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unleash Your Auditory Adventures  Installing Apple Podcasts App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-secrets-to-successful-mov-file-recording-in-windows-10/"><u>[New] In 2024, Secrets to Successful MOV File Recording in Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-authoritative-insights-on-premium-auto-cam-tech/"><u>[Updated] Authoritative Insights on Premium Auto Cam Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-mastering-thumbnail-extraction-from-youtube-on-multiple-platforms-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Thumbnail Extraction From Youtube on Multiple Platforms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-photoshop-grading-made-simple-for-everyone/"><u>[Updated] Photoshop Grading Made Simple for Everyone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-achieve-stunning-visual-impact-top-color-grading-tutorials/"><u>2024 Approved  Achieve Stunning Visual Impact -

How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for Mac</h2><p>Picture-in-Picture PiP mode is a feature that allows you to view movies in a tiny floating window while surfing another website in Safari or doing something else on your Mac. It remains in the foreground of your screen regardless of which new program you start on your PC.</p><p>To experience Picture in Picture on Mac, you must first launch Safari. You may use Safari’s PiP mode on any video content website. Other browsers do not currently support this functionality.</p><p>Another consideration is that some websites may not support Picture in Picture. In this situation, you will be unable to watch your chosen videos unless you use particular programs that support them. However, because each site operates differently, the procedure you must use to enter this mode may differ.</p><h3 id="Entry-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac"><a href="#Entry-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Entry Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac"></a>Entry Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac</h3><p>Let’s have a look at how to use Picture in Picture in Safari on Mac:</p><ul><li>After you start Safari, you may go to any website you choose.</li><li>Find the videos you wish to view and press the play button.</li><li>Once it starts playing, you will notice a <strong>small sound icon</strong> at the top tab; you can <strong>right-click or hold control</strong> while clicking on this icon.</li><li>You will notice a drop-down where you can select the <strong>“Enter Picture in Picture.”</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-2.jpg"                      alt="enter picture in picture"                ></p><ul><li>Suppose you opened the video tab only; you will see the small sound icon in the address bar.

You can perform several tasks to your taste as you keep watching and working. If you feel the size is too small or big, you can resize it by dragging any corner of the video. Furthermore, you can click and pull it to any side of the window if it disturbs your view.</p><p>There is a play and pause button available also as well as the forward and backward if you wish to perform any of these activities. And again, you can decide to turn off this feature by repeating the procedure where you locate the small sound icon. But here, you select the mute this tab instead or click the “<strong>X”</strong> button at the top left corner to stop the video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for iPhone</h2><p>As we have discussed earlier, users have a way to enable the picture in picture mode before launching iOS14, where the feature is incorporated in the settings. Thanks to Apple’s new APIs, this functionality is no longer limited to watching videos while working on other apps with iOS 15. However, the following procedure is how you can enable the picture in picture mode on your iPhone.</p><ul><li>Go to your iPhone’s <strong>“Settings”</strong> and scroll to the <strong>General</strong></li><li>Search for <strong>Picture in Picture</strong> in the <strong>General</strong> section and click on the option.</li><li>Once it opens, you will see a toggle button for <strong>Start PiP Automatically</strong>; turn it <strong>ON</strong> to enable it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-3.jpg"                      alt="start pip automatically"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You perform the above procedure also to disable the feature.

In the battle of podcast vs. YouTube, which one would you pick? One or both? You may upload videos on YouTube or create podcasts.</p><p>One reason to use Spotify for podcasts is that it’s a global platform, meaning your podcast can be heard by a large audience worldwide.</p><p>Spotify is a popular platform, so listeners will likely discover your podcast through them. Putting out a video on YouTube is more work than creating a podcast; however, it may be rewarding. Read and find which one is the best!</p><h2 id="A-Brief-Overview-of-Podcast-vs-YouTube"><a href="#A-Brief-Overview-of-Podcast-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="A Brief Overview of Podcast vs. YouTube"></a>A Brief Overview of Podcast vs. YouTube</h2><p>There’s no denying that YouTube is one of the most popular online platforms. Millions of people use it daily to watch videos on everything from current events to how-to guides.</p><p>But YouTube isn’t the only game in town regarding online video.</p><p>Podcasts are also becoming increasingly popular, especially among people who commute or have long car journeys. So, which is better - YouTube or podcasts?</p><p>There’s a massive range of content available on YouTube. No matter your interests, you’re sure to find something to watch. YouTube videos are usually shorter than podcasts, so they’re perfect for busy people who don’t have time to commit to an extended episode.</p><p>You can watch YouTube videos on your phone or tablet, even if you’re not connected to the internet. So it is perfect for when you’re on the go. Now talking about podcasts, they can be downloaded and listened to offline, so you can listen even if you’re not connected to the internet.</p><p>The difference between podcasts and YouTube is that Podcasts are usually longer than YouTube videos. So they can be great for getting in-depth information on a topic. In addition, you may listen to podcasts while doing other things, such as driving or cooking.</p><p>Lately, investing your time in creating a meaningful video podcast makes more sense. The editing process of a podcast will be simpler than editing a YouTube video. You’ll only have to focus on audio when working on the podcast.</p><p>On the other hand, YouTube will require more attention to detail while working on the video, audio, subtitle, and description. Some may simultaneously work on videos and podcasts, creating content for both platforms. Many creators upload videos on YouTube and convert them into podcasts.</p><p>| |  Podcast                                                 | YouTube                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |<br>| ———————————————————- | —————————————————————————————————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————- |<br>| What is it                                                 | Podcasts are audio streaming services that let you listen to episodic content, such as interviews or news reports, on your computer or mobile device. | YouTube is a video-sharing website and online video platform.

However, they both have their unique benefits and drawbacks. Here’s a quick rundown of the critical differences between podcasts and YouTube.</p><p>You’ll need a steady internet connection and time to watch a YouTube video. Podcasts are more convenient to listen to while doing other things, such as commuting or working out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="funny kids videos on youtube can get millions of views"                ></p><p>On the downside, podcasts generally don’t have the same production value as YouTube videos, so they can sometimes feel “cheap” or “amateurish.” On the other hand, YouTube videos usually have better production value than podcasts due to content creators’ higher level of investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="apple has launched podcasts in competition with spotify"                ></p><p>YouTube also offers a more diverse range of content than podcasts since anyone can upload a video. However, YouTube videos can be much more explanatory than podcasts, making them less convenient to consume.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-3.jpg"                      alt="writing a good description with tags will help get views"                ></p><h2 id="Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa"><a href="#Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa" class="headerlink" title="Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?"></a>Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?</h2><p>Many love podcasts. They have the convenience of being able to create and listen to podcasts on the go. And there are also a lot of people who love YouTube videos. They love the visuals and the ability to watch their favorite videos whenever possible.</p><p>So, what if you could combine these two? Can you transform a podcast into a YouTube video or vice versa? It turns out you can! There are a few different options, so you don’t have to choose between a podcast or YouTube.</p><p>If you have a podcast that you want to turn into a YouTube video, one option is to record the audio from the podcast and turn it into a video file. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record your podcast as you’re playing it. This will give you a video of the audio and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>If you have a YouTube video that you want to turn into a podcast, one option is to download the audio from the video and transform it into an MP3 file. You can then share this MP3 file with your favorite podcasting platform.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record the video as you’re playing it. This will give you an audio file of the video and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this audio file to your favorite podcasting platform and share it with the world.</p><p>Lastly, you may present a podcast on your webcam and record the video and audio for YouTube. Meanwhile, use the audio to upload as a podcast. Then, your listeners and viewers can watch the video and listen to the podcast on the go.</p><p>And if you have a podcast that’s doing well, you can create a YouTube video series based on it. Alternatively, if you have a popular YouTube channel, you can create a podcast based on your videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718728&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Basic HD - Software based live production. vMix Basic HD includes 4 inputs, 3 cameras, streaming, recording, playlist.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode"><a href="#What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode"></a>What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode</h2><p><strong>Pros and Cons of a YouTube video:</strong></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>No physical office is required.

One way is to use Google AdSense. With AdSense, you can place ad units on your videos and earn money based on the traffic your videos generate.</p><p>Another way to monetize your content is by selling products or services through videos and podcasts. For example, you can use a platform like Gumroad to sell digital products or a service like Patreon to sell memberships or access exclusive content.</p><p>You can also use your YouTube channel and podcast to drive your website or blog traffic. You can then monetize your website or blog through advertising, affiliate marketing, or selling products and services.</p><p>Whatever approach you take, make sure that you are providing value to your audience.

To know which is better, podcast or YouTube, you may have to learn about the statistics. Podcasts are seeing a resurgence in popularity, while YouTube is still the top video site in the world. About 383.7 million podcast listeners globally as of November 2022.</p><p>Out of these podcast listeners, 50% are between 12-34 in age, and 43% are between 35-54 in age. In Canada, 1 in 3 people listens to a podcast. The country recorded the highest viewership in the world in 2022. Australian and US podcast listeners are at the top in 2022.</p><p>This number is at 2.1 billion monthly active users for YouTube based all around the world. The global audience of 95% of YouTube viewers is adults between 18 and 29.</p><p>Talking about ads, 80% of podcast listeners believe product ads in a podcast lead to purchase. YouTube also has massive ad growth of 5% ad revenue growth to $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022.</p><h2 id="Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube"><a href="#Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube"></a>Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube</h2><p>There are many opportunities and challenges for creating podcasts and YouTube videos. Podcasts can be a great way to share your knowledge and stories with others while also building an audience.</p><p>However, making an exciting podcast is tricky, and creating a good one takes time and effort. One of the biggest challenges is finding a good topic. In addition, you need to be passionate about what you’re talking about if you want your podcast to be successful.</p><p>Another challenge is finding the right audio or video equipment. If you don’t have the right tools, your podcast will sound poor, and your videos will look amateurish. In addition, many podcasters and YouTubers may struggle to edit videos initially. As a result, people don’t spend much time on their channels.</p><p>There are also many opportunities for making money from podcasts and YouTube videos. For example, you can sell advertising space, sell merchandise, or get sponsorships. Furthermore, you may get famous and get invited to events.</p><h2 id="Key-Factors-to-Consider-When-Deciding-How-to-Share-Content"><a href="#Key-Factors-to-Consider-When-Deciding-How-to-Share-Content" class="headerlink" title="Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content"></a>Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content</h2><p>When it comes to deciding how to share your content on podcast vs. YouTube, there are a few things you’ll want to consider.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the goal?</strong> The first thing you’ll want to determine is the goal of sharing your content. Are you looking to build an audience for your podcast or video channel, generate leads for your business, or simply leave a meaningful legacy behind?</li><li>The second factor you’ll want to consider is <strong>your audience size and engagement</strong>. How many people will actually listen to or watch your content? And how engaged are they with it? Do they regularly share it on social media or respond positively to reviews?</li><li><strong>What format should your content be in?</strong> For example, should it be an audio-only podcast, a video-only channel, or a mixture of both? And what style should it be in – formal or informal?</li><li><strong>You’ll need to ensure that your content is creative and innovative.</strong> Is something unique about your topic that will make it stand out from the crowd? Or do you have new ideas that could be valuable for others to learn about?</li><li><strong>Pick the right niche.</strong> For example, a cooking show may not work well as a podcast, but it could be great as a YouTube series.</li><li><strong>You’ll want to promote your content in the appropriate channels.</strong> If you’re creating a YouTube series based on your podcast, promote it on your podcast platform and your YouTube channel.</li><li><strong>Focus on building skills.</strong> If your current skill level is at a beginner level, you may do well making less complex videos and podcasts. Using tools such as Filmora may help you create and edit videos.</li><li><strong>How you create and promote content may also depend on your budget.</strong> So be mindful of your budget and expand when you receive the proper engagement.</li></ol><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>So, which is excellent in the battle of podcast vs. YouTube video? That depends on your personal preferences. If you’d like to create in-depth, topic-focused content, podcasts are probably a better choice.</p><p>If you prefer to create playful and exciting content, then vlogs might be more your thing. Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide which format you prefer. You may start with the easier one and learn how to create both podcasts and YouTube videos simultaneously.</p><p>What Is the Difference Between Podcasts and YouTube?</p><p>Podcasts and YouTube are popular audio&#x2F;video platforms for uploading and consuming content. However, they both have their unique benefits and drawbacks. Here’s a quick rundown of the critical differences between podcasts and YouTube.</p><p>You’ll need a steady internet connection and time to watch a YouTube video. Podcasts are more convenient to listen to while doing other things, such as commuting or working out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="funny kids videos on youtube can get millions of views"                ></p><p>On the downside, podcasts generally don’t have the same production value as YouTube videos, so they can sometimes feel “cheap” or “amateurish.” On the other hand, YouTube videos usually have better production value than podcasts due to content creators’ higher level of investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="apple has launched podcasts in competition with spotify"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>YouTube also offers a more diverse range of content than podcasts since anyone can upload a video.

It turns out you can! There are a few different options, so you don’t have to choose between a podcast or YouTube.</p><p>If you have a podcast that you want to turn into a YouTube video, one option is to record the audio from the podcast and turn it into a video file. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record your podcast as you’re playing it. This will give you a video of the audio and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>If you have a YouTube video that you want to turn into a podcast, one option is to download the audio from the video and transform it into an MP3 file.

This will give you an audio file of the video and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this audio file to your favorite podcasting platform and share it with the world.</p><p>Lastly, you may present a podcast on your webcam and record the video and audio for YouTube.

To know which is better, podcast or YouTube, you may have to learn about the statistics. Podcasts are seeing a resurgence in popularity, while YouTube is still the top video site in the world. About 383.7 million podcast listeners globally as of November 2022.</p><p>Out of these podcast listeners, 50% are between 12-34 in age, and 43% are between 35-54 in age. In Canada, 1 in 3 people listens to a podcast. The country recorded the highest viewership in the world in 2022. Australian and US podcast listeners are at the top in 2022.</p><p>This number is at 2.1 billion monthly active users for YouTube based all around the world. The global audience of 95% of YouTube viewers is adults between 18 and 29.</p><p>Talking about ads, 80% of podcast listeners believe product ads in a podcast lead to purchase. YouTube also has massive ad growth of 5% ad revenue growth to $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube-1"><a href="#Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube"></a>Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube</h2><p>There are many opportunities and challenges for creating podcasts and YouTube videos. Podcasts can be a great way to share your knowledge and stories with others while also building an audience.</p><p>However, making an exciting podcast is tricky, and creating a good one takes time and effort. One of the biggest challenges is finding a good topic. In addition, you need to be passionate about what you’re talking about if you want your podcast to be successful.</p><p>Another challenge is finding the right audio or video equipment. If you don’t have the right tools, your podcast will sound poor, and your videos will look amateurish. In addition, many podcasters and YouTubers may struggle to edit videos initially. As a result, people don’t spend much time on their channels.</p><p>There are also many opportunities for making money from podcasts and YouTube videos. For example, you can sell advertising space, sell merchandise, or get sponsorships. Furthermore, you may get famous and get invited to events.</p><h2 id="Key-Factors-to-Consider-When-Deciding-How-to-Share-Content-1"><a href="#Key-Factors-to-Consider-When-Deciding-How-to-Share-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content"></a>Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content</h2><p>When it comes to deciding how to share your content on podcast vs. YouTube, there are a few things you’ll want to consider.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the goal?</strong> The first thing you’ll want to determine is the goal of sharing your content. Are you looking to build an audience for your podcast or video channel, generate leads for your business, or simply leave a meaningful legacy behind?</li><li>The second factor you’ll want to consider is <strong>your audience size and engagement</strong>. How many people will actually listen to or watch your content? And how engaged are they with it? Do they regularly share it on social media or respond positively to reviews?</li><li><strong>What format should your content be in?</strong> For example, should it be an audio-only podcast, a video-only channel, or a mixture of both? And what style should it be in – formal or informal?</li><li><strong>You’ll need to ensure that your content is creative and innovative.</strong> Is something unique about your topic that will make it stand out from the crowd? Or do you have new ideas that could be valuable for others to learn about?</li><li><strong>Pick the right niche.</strong> For example, a cooking show may not work well as a podcast, but it could be great as a YouTube series.</li><li><strong>You’ll want to promote your content in the appropriate channels.</strong> If you’re creating a YouTube series based on your podcast, promote it on your podcast platform and your YouTube channel.</li><li><strong>Focus on building skills.</strong> If your current skill level is at a beginner level, you may do well making less complex videos and podcasts. Using tools such as Filmora may help you create and edit videos.</li><li><strong>How you create and promote content may also depend on your budget.</strong> So be mindful of your budget and expand when you receive the proper engagement.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4535075&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/GU-500_672.png"                      border="0"                >Glary Utilities PRO -  Premium all-in-one utility to clean, speed up, maintain and protect your PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>So, which is excellent in the battle of podcast vs. YouTube video?
